Exploration activities  Explorations are an essential part of this course. Students, often in groups, make sense of the mathematics and take ownership of the content by discovering relationships through hands-on activities. I am happy to share the classroom worksheets on which this course is based. In fact, I plan to continue to use handouts for most of the inclass explorations even after this textbook is complete. I plan to add many of these to an instructor-accessible website. Instructors wanting to use these sooner should email me!     Interactive Online Version  For those of you reading this in a PDF or in print, I encourage you to also check out the interactive online version, which makes navigating the book a little easier. Additionally, many of the activities are implemented as GeoGebra or Polypad applets, which allow you to work interactively inside the textbook. Some exercises can be checked inside the online textbook and hyperlinks to definitions and other items are included.  My hope is to add other features, like how-to-use-the-software videos, in the future. You can view the interactive version for free at .    "

  "title": "Invitation to Explore",
  "body": " Invitation to Explore   To The Student  This class may be different from many of the mathematics classes you have taken in the past. You will be encouraged to explore geometrical ideas, solve puzzles, make conjectures, discuss with classmates, make connections between ideas, explain your solutions, and justify your reasoning. You should not expect to be shown how to do problems by the instructions. In fact, there may not be one, single right way to complete some of the problems but rather many acceptable ways of coming to a solution. Your teacher will encourage you to share these alternative approaches with the class.  Perhaps this course would be easier for you if you were simply told how to solve the problems, but the objective of this course is not to learn facts and methods, but rather to develop your mathematical thinking and communication skills. In this technological age, computers can do many of the algorithms and processes that used to be the core of mathematics education, but they have not replaced man’s role of developing strategies to solve problems and recognizing when mathematics can be applied to real world situations. Developing these reasoning skills will help you more in your future than simply being able to quote the Theorem. On the other hand, it is still useful to know the Pythagorean Theorem so that you are able to recognize when it can (and cannot) be used to solve both elementary and complex problems. This theorem along with some other basic formulas you have learned in the past (and can look up online) form a toolbox for our work, but we will give more emphasis to the creative process that is mathematics.  In A Mathematician’s Lament Paul Lockhart describes a nightmare in which music was taught in the same way that mathematics is currently taught. He says,   Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful beauty; to be alive.  If we were to teach music via lecture and mere recall, focusing on the notation and structure, but not allowing students to experience and create music, the subject would be dry and uninteresting, the creative process would be stifled, and very few would have an interest in learning music. Yet, that is what we have done with much of our mathematics instruction. We have removed both the exploration and the fun.    So I encourage you to embrace the experience that is mathematics. Approach each puzzle with an open mind, make guesses as to what is happening, and experiment to determine whether your ideas are correct. Play with the materials and the concepts and ask new questions. In this course, you might even be invited to explore a question you posed instead of the one the teacher originally posed! Mathematics is not just about finding the answer; even when there is an answer, our work should evoke new questions: Why? What else?    First Exploration   Tiling Rectangles with Polyominoes   Although this task is to fill a box, you are encouraged to think outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect as you respond to the \"why\" questions and sharing your ideas with your classmates will also contribute greatly to your learning. Have fun!    Fill the blue square with non-overlapping copies of the green L-shaped tetronimo. How many tetrominoes are required?  To use the interactive tool, click and drag the L-shape to create a new copy of the shape. Use the large dot, to rotate the copy. Arrange copies to cover the blue square. This may also be done on paper.     Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon      Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a tetromino  tetromino  polyomino  tetromino is a flat figure created by joining four congruent squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape, and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain why you believe the tiling is impossible.  Once again in the application, copies of the I-shape, Z-shape, T-shape, and small square can be created by clicking the shape and dragging. Four larger squares are provided; try to tile one with the I-shape, one with the Z-shape, etc.      Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon      Since a tetromino is formed by joining four unit squares, each tetromino has an area of four square units, as illustrated here.   The L-tetromino drawn as a joining of four square tiles.   What is the area of the square that you filled with tetrominoes?    Similarly, we define a pentomino  pentomino  polyomino pentomino to be a figure formed by joining five congruent squares along edges. One pentomino is pictured. Create new pentominoes by copying and moving the provided purple unit square. Note that if two pentominoes are reflections or rotations of each other we consider them to be the same pentomino. Be sure to save a copy of your sketch for future reference.    Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon     There are twelve different pentominoes. Did you find them all?   The pentominoes may be labeled as F, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, y, and Z. Can you figure out which is which?    Use some of the pentominoes you created to build solid rectangles.   What dimensions are possible? Does it matter whether you restrict yourself to never using a pentomino more than once in a rectangle?    Can you build a rectangle that uses every pentomino exactly once?   The hint below gives access to an interactive tool.   Use the interactive Polypad activity below or access a fullscreen version at Polypad by Mathigon using the link Pentomino Set .     Are there any rectangles that cannot be filled using only pentominoes? Why?    As you participated in this exploration, what did you wonder? What did you notice about area?   There is no right or wrong answer here! Write something!     More Explorations with Pentominoes   Note to instructor: Questions from this exploration may be used as an in-class supplement to the first exploration, as a homework assignment, or omitted.    To simplify our discussion, we can call each pentomino by the letter it most resembles, namely F, I, L, P, T, U, V, W, X, y, Z, and N. The F and N pentominos are less obvious and are identified below. Sketch and identify the others or refer to and label your earlier sketches.   The F-pentomino is three squares tall with an extra square attached to the middle of these three on one side and an extra square attached to the top square on the other side. The N-pentomino has a column of three squares and a column of two squares. Slide one of the columns so that the two columns only share a single side of a square and the total height is four units.     Observe how a larger copy of the L-pentomino tile can be created by filling it with four different pentominoes:   The basic L-pentomino next to a L-shaped pentomino built from basic L-, I-, F-, and P-pentominoes.      How are the height and width of the new larger L-tile related to the height and width of the basic L-tile?    How is the area of the new larger L-tile related to the area of the basic L-tile?    Choose another pentomino from among F, I, P, T, U, W, y, and Z, and demonstrate how it can be created using four distinct polyominoes. Note that this cannot be done with X or V.      Use the interactive Polypad activity below or access a fullscreen version at Polypad by Mathigon using the link Pentomino Set .     On the other hand, it is possible to create a copy of the V tile that is three times the height and width of the basic V tile by filling it with nine distinct pentominoes.   Show how this can be done.    How does the new area compare with the original?    Explore whether other pentominoes can be tripled in this way.       What happens to the area of a figure when its height and width of are doubled? tripled? How does the number of basic pentominoes needed to fill the figure change?      Learning from the Explorations  The purpose of is two-fold. It introduces the exploratory nature of the course and it also suggests a few important geometric facts and definitions that we will use as our initial geometrical foundation. These facts are chosen because they are intuitively obvious, but they give us some building blocks we will need to justify more complex ideas. We state them here for clarity and future reference beginning with a definition for area.   area   The area of a closed figure in the plane is the number of unit squares needed to fill the figure without any gaps or overlaps.    We noted that each tetromino was made up of four unit squares and each pentomino consisted of five unit squares; thus the area of a tetromino is four square units and the area of a pentomino is five square units. We also recalled the area formula for a rectangle.   Area of a Rectangle   The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width; in symbols, .    Another observation is that if you can fill a closed region with smaller shapes so that none of the smaller shapes overlap and no part of the region is left uncovered, then the area of the region is equal to the sum of the areas of the smaller shapes. While this may seem like a simple idea, we will see that it allows us to determine the area formulas of other geometric shapes and to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. We can dissect dissect shape into smaller shapes, rearrange them into another shape, and argue that the two regions have the same area because they both consist of the same colllection of smaller shapes.   Additivity of Area   If a region can be cut into non-overlapping sections, the area of the whole region is equal to the sum of the areas of the sections.    We applied these two principles in where we attempted to construct rectangles using pentominoes. Since pentominoes have an area of five square units, we could only construct rectangles with areas divisible by 5, namely 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60. To construct a rectangle of area 10, the same pentomino must be used twice. In the same way, any shape made up entirely of tetrominoes must have an area divisible by 4.  Finally, we observed that when the lengths of all sides of a two-dimensional figure are doubled (or tripled), the area of the figure is muliplied by 4 (or 9). This is easy to observe in a rectangle with length and width . When we create a new rectangle with length and width , the resulting area is square units.    Exploring to Learn  Hopefully as you worked through these tasks, you allowed yourself to experiment with different arrangements of squares and polyominoes. This openness to creative exploration is essential to mathematical thinking. Phrases like \"what if\" or \"I wonder\" arise often as mathematicians create and make sense of new ideas. If you find yourself wanting to explore a question arising from a task but not explicitly asked, jot down your question and share it with your instructor. Your instructor might encourage you to investigate your question or even invite your classmates to consider it. Some questions may be addressed in a later section, too tangential, beyond the scope of this course, or even unsolved by the mathematical community. Thus your instructor will make the decision on which questions to pursue and when.   You may have noticed that you and your peers discovered different ways of completing the same task. Multiple approaches and multiple solutions are often welcome and even encouraged! If you have a strategy that is different than your group members, try both separately and then compare. You have the ability to do the mathematics, but it will be more meaningful if you attack tasks in a way that makes sense to you. This will require you and your peers to take some risks, to challenge you to speak up, and to be nonjudgmental of others.  In fact, doing mathematics is a social activity. When we notice patterns and make conjectures, we share our ideas with others and use logic to make convincing arguments. For over 2500 years, mathematicians have been adding to the body of mathematical knowledge; some of which has been shared with you during your studies. The field of mathematics continues to grow.  Unfortunately, most students have had little opportunity to creatively explore in their mathematics classes. You have probably memorized formulas and performed calculations in many of your mathematics classes. While formulas and calculations are useful tools in mathematics, they are not the essence of mathematics and can often be done via a computer. In this course, we will develop the creative thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving practices that set humans apart computers and are valued by employers. We will think outside the box, make predictions, and wonder why. Different approaches and strategies are encouraged. Relax and have fun exploring mathematics!     Exercises   Skills and Recall   Exercises in this section are designed to check that you have understood the main ideas and that you can perform the skills, techniques, and formulas needed to move on in the course. Exercises in this group may also encourage practice of skills that appear in education licensure exams.    Determine the area of each shape in .   Shapes for   Shape 1 is a cross formed by two equal length intersecting bars. Each bar is 2 inches by 8 inches so that their intersection is a 2 by 2 square. Shape 2 is more irregular, close to a rotated L-shape with a 1 by 1 square removed near where the legs meet. One leg of the L is 8 inches long and 2 inches wide. The other is 7 inches long and 3 inches wide.      Refer to as you answer the following:   Find the area of rectangle with height 14 cm. and width 6cm. Then use your answer to find the area of right triangle .      Find the area of rectangle with height cm. and width cm.    What is the area of parallelogram ? How do you know?        Determine the area of rectangle with height cm.    Determine the area of right triangle .    Determine the area of trapezoid .        Shapes for   The first two shapes are described in the problem. Trapezoid IJKL in the third problem consists of a right triangle OJI and rectangle ILKO with a common side IO. The height and width of the triangle is the same, namely 6 cm. The width of the rectangle is 10 cm.      How many distinct triominoes exist? Sketch them. Do not include any triominoes that are reflections or rotations of ones you have already sketched.   There are just two.   One is I-shaped; the other L-shaped.    A hexomino is constructed from six squares. Explain why it is impossible to construct a solid rectangle with area twenty using non-overlapping hexomino tiles.    Jay constructs a solid rectangle using heptomino (seven-square) tiles. What must be true about the area of Jay's rectangle?       Show that it is possible to construct a rectangle of area 10 using pentominoes if you are allowed to reuse the same tile.    Show that if you are allowed to use copies of the same pentomino (4-square) tile multiple times you can construct a rectangle of area for every whole number . (Hint: Use the same tetromino times.)       Sketch all the different rectangles with no gaps or overlaps that can be created by a single set of five tetrominoes. You don't have to use all of the tetrominoes in each rectangles and you may use a new set of tetrominoes for each rectangle; however no rectangle will use a single tile more than once.   The Area Model for Multiplication  This problem illustrates the Area Model for Multiplication, an effective way of helping elementary school students visualize the operation of multiplication. area model for multiplication    On graph paper sketch a rectangle. Show the fifteen squares that make up the area.    Note that 12 can be factored as , , or . Sketch area models for each of these products.        Extending the Concepts   Area Model for Two-digit Numbers  Multiplication of two-digit numbers can be represented using the area model: for example, to multiply 47 by 25 we can represent 47 as 4 tens and 7 ones and 25 as 2 tens and 5 ones. We then can sketch the product as shown.   A rectangle labeled with sides 40+7 and 20+5 and split into subrectangles 40 by 20, 40 by 5, 7 by 20, and 7 by 5.      Determine the area of each of the four subrectangles pictured. Here, the squares on the grid are not but defined by the notations on the sides.    Add the four areas of the subrectangles together to find the total area.     The standard algorithm to multiply is shown. Identify what the 235 and 940 in the algorithm represent in the area model pictured at the beginning of this exercise.    47    25    235    + 940    1175          Multiplication of Multidigit Numbers  Sketch an area model illustration of the product , not necessarily drawn to scale, but with each side length broken down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones as appropriate. Demonstrate how this area model can be used to compute the product.   Modeling the Multiplication of Fractions and Mixed Numbers     Draw a square and assume each side has length of 1. Divide the height equally into thirds and the width equally into fourths. How many subrectangles does this split the square into? What is the area of each subrectangle? What does this tell you about ?    The sketch shows a model of . Compute the areas of each of the four shaded regions (blue, orange, pink, and green), and then compute the total. Note that solid lines are used to represent lengths of whole units and dashed lines represent fractional lengths   A 3 by 2 rectangle. The side of length 2 is split into one whole unit and five fifths. The side of length 3 is split into two whole units and three thirds. The upper 1\/3 strip and rightmost 1\/5 strip are unshaded. The two 1 by 1 squares are shaded blue. Two one by one-third rectangles are orange. Four one-fifth by one rectangles are pink and there are four green one third by one-fifth rectangles forming a 2\/3 by 2\/5 rectangle.     Draw an area model of by dividing the unit length into fifths and the unit width into fourths. Shade and compute the product. Explain how you find the numerator and denominator of the unsimplified fraction from the sketch.      Modeling the Multiplication of Polynomials  The sketch below illustrates a product of polynomials.   A rectangle cut into four subrectangles. The left side is made up of a segment of length 7 plus a segment of length x with a horizontal line cutting the rectangle between these two segments. The bottom edge is composed of a segment of length 5 plus a segment of length 4x. A vertical line cuts the rectangle between these two segments.      Write the height of the entire rectangle as an algebraic expression involving the variable .    Write the width of the entire rectangle as an algebraic expression involving the variable .    Algebraically compute the area of the entire rectangle as the product of your two algebraic expressions. Show your work.    Find the area geometrically by finding the areas of the four subrectangles and adding the areas together. Show your work. Did you get the same result?      Area in Probability  A tetrahedral die is a triangular pyramid with four sides numbered 1 through 4. Because the die is shaped like a triangular pyramid, there is no top face so the number rolled will correspond to the top point if the dice are labeled like the ones to the right. If three tetrahedral die are rolled the possible sums range from 3 to 12. For example, consider the sum 5 which can be achieved by each of the following six rolls: (1,1,3), (1,2,2), (1,3,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (3,1,1).   Determine all of the ways that a sum of 9 can occur.    List all of the ways that a sum of 6 can be rolled.    The sketch below is a bar graph or histogram showing the frequency or number of ways that each of the sums from 3 to 12 can be rolled with three tetrahedral dice. Note that the sums are given on the horizontal axis and the frequencies are on the vertical axis.   What is the total number of possible rolls?    What is the number of rolls resulting in 7?    The probability of an event is computed by dividing the number of different rolls meeting the criteria for that event by the total number of different possible rolls. What is the probability of rolling a 7 with three tetrahedral dice?         Frequency of sums of tetrahedral dice rolls   A symmetric histogram graph is shown. The following rectangular bars appear on the graph, each with width 1 and base on the x-axis. Above the number 3 and above the number 12, sits a rectangle with height 1. Above both 4 and 11, the bar's height is 3. Above both 5 and 10, the height is 6. Above both 6 and 9, the height is 10. And above both 7 and 8, the height is 12.       Writing Prompt  Mathematical Autobiography Write an essay (2 to 4 pages) in which you discuss the experiences in your life that have formed you as a mathematician or geometer. This essay will be unique to you, but here are some questions that you might consider in your reflection: Were there any turning points in your education? What experiences have stimulated and which have stimied your mathematical growth? Are there obstacles that you have overcome or would like to overcome? How? What are you personal goals in this course? What do you see as personal challenges to being successful? The paper should not be a mere timeline (boring!) or a list of answers to the questions above (disjointed), but instead should be a cohesive essay that focuses on the development of your mathematical ability, confidence, and attitude, centering on a few key turning points. Examples of experiences that help illustrate your statements should be included. How did the class format (lecture, testing, activities, interaction, pacing) change you? Did you have experiences beyond the classroom that affected your mathematical growth?  You may be asked to look back on this essay at the end of the semester to assess personal growth. Your instructor may also use this autobiography to better understand you as a student. In case your instructor knows your past teachers, use pseudonyms or letters to refer to them. The essay should focus on you, not your teachers.    "

  "title": "Invitation to Apply Knowledge",
  "body": " Invitation to Apply Knowledge    Building a Course Toolbox  Throughout our learning, and in fact throughout our lives, we add knowledge to our toolkit that we can later reference as needed. The tools in our toolkit can then be used to solve problems, to further build our understanding of related concepts, and to support the validity of an argument. Most likely, you are already familiar with some of these tools from previous coursework. You know how to perform computations, have used geometric formulas, and can recognize many shapes.  Although you already know some of the facts and formulas, we will develop a toolbox from the ground up in this course, starting with basic principles and assumptions that are intuitively obvious. With geometric formulas and theorems, we will want to explore why these are true before adding them to our toolbox. When we need to assume a statement without proving it, we will acknowledge the assumption and identify it as a principle rather than a theorem. Theorems will be justified logically from the principles and previously proved theorems. Definitions are developed to give us helpful terminology and state the characteristics needed to identify the object. We typically do not include every property of an object in the definition; some properties can be proved from the initial definition. For example, we define a rectangle to be a quadraliteral with four right angles. The property that opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent is not included in the definition, because it can be proved from the definition.  Depending on the level of a geometry textbook and the author's goals, you will see some differences between the statements of geometric definitions and principles (also called axioms). For this reason, a proof you find elsewhere may not be sufficient here due to its reliance on different assumptions. Students are encouraged to use the resources in this text for their work. In addition, you should be mindful of the order in which theorems are introduced as you cannot use a theorem that comes later in the textbook as an argument in a proof. On the other hand, this textbook is not as rigorous as some geometry textbooks. In order to maintain the exploratory and intuitive nature of this book, the author will include some principles here that might appear as proved theorems in other texts. At times, proofs may be included as exercises leaving the choice of rigor up to the course instructor.   Currently our course toolbox only contains the definition of area and two principles, and from . In other words, we can think about the area of a region as the number of blocks that fills the interior, we can use the area formula for a rectangle, and we know that the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. Hopefully, you will agree that length should also be additive; namely, that if we extend a segment of length by a segment of length , the resulting segment has length . We restate this below:   To view the statements of the earlier principles, click on each corresponding link. .    Additivity of Length   Suppose that is a point on the interior of line segment , then the length of equals the sum of the lengths of and .    Since we are most interested in discovering facts and formulas that will hold for a whole class of geometric shapes, we will often use variables to represent numerical quantities such as length, area, and angle measure. We include in our toolbox the algebraic rules and procedures in that allow us to perform calculations, simplify expressions, and solve equations. There is a section in this book's appendix (back matter) on algebra for your review and reference.  Eventually we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean theorem, area formulas for other shapes, and other geometrical theorems and formulas, but the reasons behind these will be explored in future sections and based on definitions and the initial principles.  As we encounter and state new definitions, these too will be added to our tool box. As you work through the next exploration, you will encounter terms like trapezoid and isosceles. Definitions for these and other terms are provided at the end of this section in case you would like to refresh your memory. You can also use the index or textbook's search tool to find definitions.   Explorations with Tangrams   In this exploration, use the tools currently in our toolbox as you answer the questions. You may find yourself wanting to use the Pythagorean theorem and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions without these formulas. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean theorem, there is probably an easier method!  A set of tangrams consists of the following seven pieces, two large triangles, one medium triangle, a parallelogram, a square, and two small triangles.   The Seven Tangrams   Seven tangram shapes. The triangles are all isosceles right triangles and the parallelogram is equilateral. The small triangles can be arranged to fill either the square, the parallelogram, or the medium triangle. The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same as the base of the large triangle.    To complete this exploration, you will need to move the seven Tangram pieces around. If you do not have a set of Tangrams, you may print and cut out the shapes shown above. A tangram interactive is also availabe on Polypad by Mathigon via the link Interactive Tangrams on Polypad by Mathigon .    Assume that the length of each side of the square is 1 unit. Determine the area of each of the figures:   The area of the square.    The area of one small triangle.    The area of the parallelogram.    The area of the medium triangle.    The area of the large triangle.       Still assuming that length of each side of the square is 1 unit, now find the lengths of the sides of the other tangram shapes. You may use the Pythagorean Theorem, but it is possible to determine these lengths without it!    Construct each of the following if possible:   A triangle using three tangram pieces.    A rectangle    A parallelogram that is not a rectangle using two pieces.    A non-isosceles trapezoid (you choose the number of pieces).    A pentagon.    A non-square rectangle using all seven pieces.    A square using all seven pieces.   What is the area of this square?    What is the side length of this square?          Were you able to answer the questions above without using the Pythagorean theorem or the area formula for a triangle? If not, explore how this might be done!   What tools do we have in our toolbox? How can these help?    In this exercise, we have practiced using our initial principles and identified some tools, namely the Pythagorean Theorem and the area formula for a triangle, that will be developed later. We also noted that there are multiple ways to solve a problem. Solutions do not need to use formulas and should evolve from what we know and what we have in our toolbox. Still, we want to grow our toolbox to increase our ability to solve problems and justify claims.  Perhaps you moved figures around and lined up sides to determine whether the lengths were the same.     Defining Polygons  In the first part of this course, we will work primarily with polygons. What is a polygon? Giving a clear, clean definition of the word \"polygon\" is difficult so we will describe it verbally and give several examples. If you search for the definition in books or on the web, you will find different attempts to give a clear definition. We will describe a polygon  polygon as being a closed plane figure formed by a sequence of straight sides. Thus, a polygon is a shape that lies in the plane or on a flat surface. By closed, we mean that a polygon will have a well-defined interior; the polygon forms a solid boundary between this interior and the rest of the plane.   Some examples of polygons    A right trapezoid   A trapezoid with two right angles, one acute angle, and one obtuse angle.     A concave pentagon.      As seen in , we distinguish between convex and concave polygons.   convex  concave  polygon convex  polygon concave   A polygon is convex polygon if every interior angle has a measure less than 180 degrees. If a polygon is not convex, then it is concave .    Not all flat shapes are polygons as illustrated in .   Examples of figures that are not polygons    Not closed.   A figure formed by line segments with a gap remaining.     Curved edges   A closed figure consisting of some straight sides and some curved sides.      Some specific types of polygons are defined below. We add these to our toolbox. An easy way to find definitions later is to use the index at the end of the textbook.    triangle  polygon triangle   A triangle is a polygon with exactly three sides.     quadrilateral  polygon quadrilateral   A quadrilateral is a polygon with exactly four sides.     polygon n-gon  polygon pentagon  polygon octagon  polygon decagon  n-gon  pentagon  octagon  decagon   A pentagon is a polygon n-gon with five sides. A hexagon has six sides. We use the general term -gon to describe a polygon with exactly sides. Other common numerical prefixes used to describe polygons include octa (eight) and deca (ten). These will be explored more in .    Some polygons are defined by the types of angles they have.   right angle  acute angle  obtuse angle  angle right  angle acute  angle obtuse   An angle is said to be a right angle if its measure is 90 degrees. Angles that have measures less than 90 degrees are said to be acute and angles with measures greater than 90 degrees are said to be obtuse .     triangle right  hypotenuse  leg right triangle  right triangle   A triangle is said to be a right triangle if one of its angles is a right angle. In a right triangle, the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse and the other two sides are called legs .     triangle acute  triangle obtuse  acute triangle  obtuse triangle   If one of its angles is obtuse, we say that a triangle is an obtuse triangle . An acute triangle is a triangle with three acute angles. We will explore the measurement of angles more in and .     quadrilateral rectangle  quadrilateral square  rectangle  square   A quadrilateral with four right angles is called a rectangle A square is a rectangle whose sides are all the same length.     equiangular   A polygon is said to be equiangular if all of its angles have the same measure.    Quadrilaterals may also be described by the existence of parallel sides.   parallel lines  parallel sides of a polygon   Two lines in the same plane are said to be parallel if they never intersect. Two line segments or two sides of a polygon are said to be parallel if the lines they are a part of are parallel. Note that a line always extends infinitely in two directions while a line segment has endpoints.     parallelogram  quadrilateral parallelogram  parallelogram altitude  parallelogram base  altitude parallelogram  base parallelogram   A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. When describing the measurements of a parallelogram, it is useful to identify one side as the base . The height of the parallelogram is measured along an altitude , namely a segment formed connecting a point on the side opposite the base to a point on the base such that the altitude meets the base at a right angle.     trapezoid  quadrilateral trapezoid  trapezoid altitude  trapezoid base  altitude trapezoid  base trapezoid  leg trapezoid   A quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides is called a trapezoid . One of the parallel sides is called the base and the other is called the summit . The remaining two sides of a trapezoid are called legs . The height of a trapezoid is the distance between the base and the summit, measured along an altitude which is perpendicular to the base.    Triangles and other polygons may also be classified by whether some of their sides have the same length. Two sides of a polygon are said to be congruent  congruent sides if they are the same length.   equilateral triangle  equilateral quadrilateral  rhombus  quadrilateral rhombus  triangle equilateral   A polygon is described as being equilateral if all of its sides are congruent. An equilateral quadrilateral is called a rhombus .     isosceles  isosceles triangle  isosceles trazezoid  triangle isosceles  trapezoid isosceles   The word isosceles comes from two Greek words, isos meaning equal and skelos meaning leg . An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two congruent sides. An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid with two congruent, non-parallel sides.     Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles  Some textbooks will restrict the term isosceles triangle to a triangle with exactly two congruent sides while others allow two or all three of the sides to be congruent. This latter definition is used when one is one wants to argue that properties of isosceles triangles extend to equilateral triangles.   Should you become a teacher, it is wise to be mindful of how your textbook uses these terms. In the early sections of this text, we will distinguish between isosceles and equilateral triangles when you are asked to sketch and identify examples. When we explore properties of triangles, you may use the fact that properties of an isosceles triangle will also hold for equilateral triangles.  In case you are curious, equilateral comes from Latin and French words meaning equal sides.    scalene  triangle scalene   A triangle with no congruent sides is said to be a scalene triangle .     kite  quadrilateral kite   A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent congruent sides. A kite has reflective (fold) symmetry across one of its diagonals.    While area measures the interior region bounded by a polygon or other closed figure in the plane, we can also measure the boundary itself.   perimeter   The perimeter of a closed figure is the total length of its boundary. In the case of a polygon, the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of its sides.      Exercises   Skills and Recall   Determine the perimeter of each of the shapes in .    Sketch pictures of each of the following:   An isosceles obtuse triangle    A rhombus that is not a square    An equiangular hexagon which is not equilateral    A concave quadrilateral       Triangle , trapezoid , and parallelogram are provided in .   Label a side of triangle as the base. Then draw an label the altitude of the triangle corresponding to that base.    Which two sides of trapezoid could be considered to be bases? Label one as the base. Also label the summit and legs of the trapezoid. Then draw and label an altitude for .    Label side as the base of parallelogram . Sketch and label the altitude for corresponding to base .    Could another side of been chosen as the base? Which one(s)? Would the altitude be the same?      Shapes for   A triangle, a trapezoid, and a parallelogram, all are drawn at an incline.      In , three smaller Tangram pieces fill a region congruent to the larger blue isosceles triangle. The square is half as tall as the blue triangle. Suppose that the area of the blue triangle is 18 square inches.   What is the area of one small orange triangle? How do you know?    What is the area of the square? How do you know?      Image for   An isosceles triangle made up of a large isosceles triangle that fills the left half. The right half consists of a square and and two small Tangram triangles, one above the square and one to the right.       Extending the Concepts   Answer the questions:  Is it possible for a triangle to be equilateral but not equiangular?  Show by example that it is possible for a quadrilateral to be equilateral but not equiangular.  Show by example that it is possible for a quadrilateral to be equiangular but not equilateral.      If two polygons have the same area, must they have the same perimeter? Support your answer using words and\/or pictures.    Sketch a polygon where the numerical value of the perimeter is equal to the numerical value of the area. Be sure to label the sides with their lengths.  Now triple the length of each side and recompute the area and the perimeter. What value(s) do you get? Are they still the same?  Assume that the original side lengths had yards as their units. What would the units be for the shape's area?      We have noted that polygons satisfy additivity of area and that segments satisfy additivity of length. Should polygons satisfy additivity of perimeter? Support your answer with pictures and words.     Writing Prompts   By the time students reaches college, they already have some geometry tools in their toolbox. What geometric tools do you bring to the course? Of these tools, which do you feel comfortable using and which do you need to learn more about? You may include tools that we have not yet covered in this textbook.    Explore the Index and Search tools in this textbook. Write a paragraph in which you discuss the benefit of these tools and how to use at least one of them.     "

The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same as the base of the large triangle.    To complete this exploration, you will need to move the seven Tangram pieces around. If you do not have a set of Tangrams, you may print and cut out the shapes shown above. A tangram interactive is also availabe on Polypad by Mathigon via the link Interactive Tangrams on Polypad by Mathigon .    Assume that the length of each side of the square is 1 unit. Determine the area of each of the figures:   The area of the square.    The area of one small triangle.    The area of the parallelogram.    The area of the medium triangle.    The area of the large triangle.       Still assuming that length of each side of the square is 1 unit, now find the lengths of the sides of the other tangram shapes. You may use the Pythagorean Theorem, but it is possible to determine these lengths without it!    Construct each of the following if possible:   A triangle using three tangram pieces.    A rectangle    A parallelogram that is not a rectangle using two pieces.    A non-isosceles trapezoid (you choose the number of pieces).    A pentagon.    A non-square rectangle using all seven pieces.    A square using all seven pieces.   What is the area of this square?    What is the side length of this square?          Were you able to answer the questions above without using the Pythagorean theorem or the area formula for a triangle? If not, explore how this might be done!   What tools do we have in our toolbox? How can these help?   "

Compute the following sums:                    Without actually adding the values, make a prediction for the following sums:                The expression is another way of writing .

Explain how you came up with your formula and why you believe it holds for all . If you were not able to come up with a formula, describe what you have discovered about these sums.      Conjectures and Explanations in Mathematics  Have you ever wondered how mathematics came into existence? A simple answer is that people explored mathematical objects, like numbers or shapes, and noticed patterns and consistencies. They then sought to convince themselves and others that these patterns were not just coincidences but would have to occur.  How do we convince others? In mathematics, we start with basic assumptions like the principles and definitions in this text and then use logic to demonstrate that our conjecture must follow. We also accept the algebraic properties of the real number system along with properties of equality and inequality, allowing us to simplify algebraic expressions and solving linear equalities and inequalities using techniques learned in previous courses. Once we prove a claim, it is no longer a conjecture and is now considered to be a theorem. We can then add the theorem to our toolbox and use it to demonstrate new claims.  Since this textbook is written for students majoring in fields other than mathematics, we will not spend time developing proof-writing techniques. Even so, everyone can benefit from learning to write clear and thorough explanations and demonstrations. Future teachers should develop the ability to explain mathematics carefully and accurately, using words, pictures, and multiple approaches that their students can understand. For a future lawyer or business professional, the practice of writing explanatory papers in mathematics will enhance their ability to present and support arguments for their cases and proposals. As you write explanations, choose an audience that makes sense for you--a student, a friend, a colleague, a jury --and use language appropriate for that audience.  How do we write mathematical explanations and establish new truths? We usually let our reader know what we claim and plan to prove. In geometry, we often accompany our explanations with a sketch on which we have labeled with the names of points and\/or variables for lengths so that our reader can follow our argument visually. We do not assign numerical values to lengths as we do not want to limit our claim to one example.  In , we discovered a formula for the sum of the first odd numbers. It appears to equal , but why? Simply observing the pattern via a few examples, does not convince us that this will also be the case for . Something strange might happen between 5 and 1000. Instead, consider the following proof by pictures :    The first four steps of a pattern are provided.    First, a 1 by 1 square. Second, four 1 by 1 squares arranged to form a 2 by 2 square. Third, a 2 by 2 square with a horizontal 1 by 2 rectangle added to the bottom and a vertical 2 by 1 rectangle added to the right and a 1 unit square in the lower right corner filled in. Finally, a 3 by 3 square has a 1 by 3 rectangle added to the bottom edge, a 3 by 1 rectangle added along the right edge, and a 1 unit square in the lower right corner.    Sketch what the fifth and sixth step of the pattern should look like.   One way of computing the area of the figure in each step is to measure the height and width and multiply. For step one we get , and for step two we get . Use this technique to determine the area of   the third figure.    the fourth figure.    the fifth figure.    the sixth figure.      The area of the third figure can also be found by computing the area of each of the four rectangles that make up the figure, namely . Show and compute the sum of the smaller rectangles   the fourth figure.    the fifth figure.    the sixth figure.        The image to the right shows an -square with two rectangles aligned with the lower and right sides, respectively. The lower right corner has been filled with a 1-unit square.   An arbitrary step in the pattern.     Write the following as unsimplified algebraic expressions with the variable :   The total area found by multiplying the height and length of the figure.    The total area found by adding the areas of the four rectangles.       What algebraic equation or formula does this work suggest? Give an explanation of why it must hold using words, pictures, geometry, and\/or algebra.      A Sample Explanatory Letter  The following letter demonstrates how we might write a thorough, yet informal, explanatory letter. Note the use of variables for a general argument and labeled sketches to help the reader follow our argument.   Dear Aunt Josephine,  I have been thinking about you a lot lately and how much I appreciated your help when I was learning algebra. You may remember how much I struggled with understanding why equals instead of in that course. In my current geometry course, I learned a geometric argument for that equation that makes more sense to me and I thought you might like it too.  In the picture below, you can see a square with side broken up into four rectangles. (Here, I am using in place of .) The area of this square is of course. Notice that is the sum of the areas of the square (top left) and the small square (lower right). These do not fill the entire square so must be greater than . The two missing pieces are rectangles with area . Adding all four pieces, we see .    Visualization of     Now that I have seen this geometrically I remember the formula much better!  I hope you and Uncle Tom are doing well. I look forward to visiting you soon.  Sid   Notice how the author Sid introduces the reader to what will be demonstrated, uses a picture to help the reader visualize the explanation, and then explains in words how the picture justifies the argument. In this example, Sid had to deal with the fact that we typically use the variable in algebra to represent any real number but the variable , representing whole numbers appeared in the sketch. Aunt Josephine was alerted to the fact that would would be used in place of and Sid consistantly used in the logical argument. The author could have drawn a new sketch and relabeled it with in place of , but chose not to do so. Since the author is using the sketch from the activity, a citation reference should be included. In fact, if a tool like Polypad or GeoGebra is used to create a sketch, the technology should be credited. Also, note how Aunt Josephine did not have to see the questions in the activity to understand Sid's explanation.   Did you notice the unstated use of in Sid's letter? Explain the role of this principle here.     Exercises   Skills and Recall   Determine two different possibilities for the next term in the sequence . Give reasons for your answers.     Extending the Concepts  A Triangular Pattern of Dots  Consider the pattern suggested by the triangles of dots:   A Sequence of Triangles   T1 is a dot. The remaining figures look like equilateral triangles. T2 contains a row of two dots and a dot above. T3 adds a row of three dots below T2. T4 adds a row of four dots below T3. T5 adds a row of five dots below T4.       List the number of dots in each of . Do not add these five numbers.    Sketch . How many dots does it have?    Without drawing the picture, how many dots should have? Why?    In , the dots in have been rearranged to form an isosceles right triangle, labeled .

Wonder in Mathematics  Watch the YouTube video . Then spend some time looking for, observing, and wondering about patterns and\/or commonalities in nature, art, language, numbers, etc. Choose one example and write about what you have observed and wondered about. In what ways might considering this example or the world around us with this sense of mathematics (as Eddie Woo describes it) change us and our understanding.    Mathematics is typically called maths throughout the United Kingdom and much of the world so it is appropriate for the speaker to use this term.      "

  "title": "Invitation to Overcome Challenges",
  "body": " Invitation to Overcome Challenges   Growing through Persistance  Have you ever watched a baby learn a new skill, like walking, crawling, or even rolling over? The child does not master the skill on the first try, but they are determined. They fall down, perhaps bump their head, but they keep trying. They readjust what they are doing, figure out how to create momentum and balance, and finally succeed. Even then they may stumble, but they persist. In the process, they grow stronger and can apply these skills to later learning, like running, climbing the cabinets, and reaching the cookie jar.  Throughout our lives, we grow by challenging ourselves to move beyond our comfort zone. We learn to read and write, to play games and sports, to cook, make music, or create art. Our brains are muscles that develop as we attempt new challenges. The nature of mathematics involves struggling with a problem, trying different strategies, taking breaks but persisting, and learning from failed attempts. In the explorations in this section, you may find that some of the problems are easy, but others require looking at the problem in new ways and trying different strategies. Accept the challenge, try out different ideas, and don't worry about making mistakes. Allow these attempts to enable growth and eventual success.   Triangles on a Geoboard   You may use tools that you remember from previous courses, such as the area formula for a triangle and the Pythagorean Theorem, as you complete this activity. We will explore why these formulas hold in .    In this exploration, we will work with a geoboard that has four rows and four columns of pins such as the one pictured below.   A grid with 16 dots arranged in four rows and four columns.      Measuring along any row, we will assume that the horizontal distance between neighboring dots on a geoboard is one unit. What is the distance across the top of the geoboard from the leftmost pin to the rightmost pin?    Similarly, the vertical distance between neighboring pins in any column will be one unit. Determine the area of the square whose vertices are the four outermost pins on this geoboard.    Determine the shortest diagonal distance between two pins. In other words, what is the distance from the pin in the upper left corner to the pin in the second row and second column?    What is the distance from the top left pin to the bottom right pin?       As we construct triangles and other shapes on our geoboard, note that each vertex must be one one of the sixteen pins.   To use the embedded interactive GeoBoard via the Polypad by Mathigon, select the line tool near the bottom. Then click and drag from one dot to another to create line segments. An easier to use GeoBoard is accessible from apps.mathlearningcenter.org\/geoboard\/ , but gives a 5x5 board instead of 4x4.      Construct a triangle with the smallest possible area. What is the area?     Construct a triangle with the largest possible area. Then construct a second triangle with the same area that is not the same shape as the first. Record your sketches and compute this area.     Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon         Construct triangles with an area different than any triangle you've already drawn. Counting the triangles you drew in , it is possible to create a total of eight triangles each with a different area. Be sure to record your sketches of the triangles and their areas for reference.    Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon    The possible areas are .    Extension: If we use a 5x5-geoboard instead, what squares and what triangles are possible? Compute the areas. A virtual 5x5-GeoBoard is available at apps.mathlearningcenter.org\/geoboard\/ .      Confronting the Challenge  To give you the experience of confronting the challenge and the exhilaration of conquering it, the answer to the last task in this exploration will not be provided here. Searching for solutions or examples will not help you grow mathematically. Instead, consider other ways in which you might attack the problem. Dare to try something new!  The above exploration starts off relatively easy. Once you understood how to create and measure shapes on the geoboard, you probably found triangles with areas of , and . In fact, you might have found multiple triangles with these areas. Yet the remaining areas may seem impossible. If you are still in this situation, think about why these same six areas keeping occurring. What do these triangles have in common? What other types of triangles exist on the GeoBoard?  As you find these new triangles, another question emerges: How does one compute the area of these triangles? To use the area formula, , one usually uses the values of and . How does one find and with certainty? Or is it necessary to find the base and height of the triangle? Might there be other ways of finding the area in the current setting?  There are many lessons to be learned here that go beyond measuring area. Mathematics is not about doing fast calculations with provided formulas or following steps. Instead, it requires persistance, creative thinking, and exploring multiple strategies. Sometimes it is helpful to walk away from a problem for a little while and to look at it differently when you return to it. It helps to share ideas with others even when you do not know where they will lead.  Did you discover a triangle that was not obvious? Did you figure out a way to compute the area of these triangles? Did you help others understand? Be proud of your discoveries and contributions. This is evidence that you, yes you, are a mathematician!  Each student brings their own individual strengths to the class. Some are great at remembering and applying formulas, some are great at drawing sketches, some recognize patterns, some build on others' ideas, some explain results and connections. In fact, you may find yourself contributing in different ways on different activities. The important thing is to believe in yourself and be open to trying new things. Unfortunately, most people believe the myth that they can't do math. They spend too much energy comparing themselves to others. Math is not about being perfect or fast. Instead it is about exploring, creating, experimenting, conjecturing, applying, and justifying.  If today was not your day to shine, perhaps you were hesitant to consider alternative approaches or to pursue your ideas. This particular topic might not have engaged you in the same way as it did others. Or maybe it was just an off day. There will be more opportunities to overcome challenges throughout this book, and so long as you are open to learning and exploring your own ideas, your mathematical ability and confidence will grow. After all, the course has just started, and you are just adapting to this book and its style, your instructor and your classmates. By the way, your brain may hurt a little as you confront and conquer mathematical challenges. Like every other muscle in your body, a little soreness means that you are growing in strength. Success comes from overcoming the struggle, from remembering and building on your accomplishments and missteps.    A Geometric Tool and an Algebraic Tool  As we have noticed in this section, not all segments are horizontal or vertical. To determine lengths of these slanted segments on a grid, the Pythagorean Theorem will be helpful. The Pythagorean Theorem allows us to find the lengths of the sides of right triangles using the fact that where is the length of the hypotenuse and and are the lengths of the legs of the triangle. We will see study the Pythagorean Theorem and explore why it holds in .  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem requires facility with the algebraic operation of squaring and its inverse operation, the square root function. A review of how to work with squares and square roots is provided in .    Exercises   Skills and Recall   Compute the following numbers if they exist.

To support your answer, choose a nonzero number and a nonzero number , substitute your values into the equation, and carefully evaluate both sides.    Is ? Explain.        Writing Prompts  Geoboard Experience  Discuss the emotions that you experienced as you were working on this activity. Did you encounter moments when you felt stuck? How long did that last? What helped you persist through the process? Were you able to get unstuck without being told answers? How did that make you feel? Feel free to discuss other emotional stages of this activity. If this particular activity did not challenge you as much as one of the earlier ones, your instructor may give you permission to discuss one of those instead. Be sure to discuss the emotions associated with struggle and challenge.   Growing via Challenges  Reflect on a time when you had to struggle to learn how to do something (not necessarily mathematics), but where you eventually succeeded. Describe the event, why and how you struggled, what helped you persist, and how you grew. Did you feel differently about this success compared to successfully completing routine tasks? Can this experience help you as you tackle tough questions in this course?     "

  "body": " Instructor Notes   General Notes on Writing  Although I am including writing prompts for most sections, I typically only assign two explanatory papers (the area formula for a trapezoid and the Pythagorean Theorem) and three to five journal essays (these vary, but typically include the autobiography, the essay on wonder, and a reflection on Lockhart's \"A Mathematician's Lament\"). I recognize that my students have little, if any, experience in writing mathematical explanations. When I teach this course, I build revisions of these two papers into the schedule and grading specifications. Some of the journal writing prompts can be assigned at any point during the course. Teaching this course in the winter\/spring semester, we typically have at least one snow day and the essay on wonder is a nice assignment to use in lieu of a class. I have found that students may not be ready to write the reflection on \"A Mathematician's Lament\" early in the semester. Well into the semester, many students are hanging on to the belief that math is simply a collection of tools to memorize and use. I also assign a final portfolio in which students discuss growth in their mathematical abilities, understanding, and attitude. I am happy to share a copy of my portfolio assignment, detailed descriptions of the two explanatory papers, and my specifications grading rubric.   Eventually, I will create a website with these handouts. Perhaps, I'll add an early and late reflection on Lockhart's essay.     Notes for  The first exploratory activity should not require much of an introduction and provides an opportunity for students to get to know a few classmates and experience a tactile or visual learning experience in a low-stress environment. Expectations of group work can begin to be established. Although this activity may be done via applets embedded within the online version of the textbook, I prefer to have my students complete this activity in small groups (three per group) with a worksheet and graph paper. A handout for the inclass version of this activity is available to instructors by request. .  I provide each group with a set of plastic pentominoes only after they have discovered most of them through experimentation. Printable pentominoes that could be cut out can easily be found on the web. For students completing this exploration in the online textbook, I have hidden the last interactive inside the hint to , so that the answer to students will take some time trying to create the twelve pentominoes in without having the answer immediately visible. For another option, this exploration is available as a Desmos classroom activity, . however, the instructor may wish to break this up (make two copies to edit) into two four-slide activities so that the slides with the pentominoes will not be visible too soon.  This activity also plays an important role in preparing students for much of the work to come. We will build upon the definition of area and two basic principles about area, and as we compute areas of other shapes and as we prove the Pythagorean theorem. We will also introduce additivity of length, angle measure, and volume. These intuitive concepts have many applications and connections. As part of the post-exploration discussion, you may want to remind the students about how area is simply the number of unit squares that fill the interior. It can be noted how the area formula for a rectangle is easy to remember and related to the operation for multiplication. We will be using the fact that the total area is preserved when a figure is cut into smaller figures and then rearranged to form a new figure. This principle will be used to derive area formulas for other figures and to demonstrate the universality of the Pythagorean Theorem.  I often assign a math autobiography at the beginning of the semester and and have students refer back to it in their final portfolio. Students often respond positively to the \"Notice and Wonder\" reflective writing assignment based on Eddie Wu's TedX talk,  . The latter makes a good \"snow day\" activity. I have been less successful with students' response to \"A Mathematician's Lament\" by Paul Lockhart. Many students fail to see how mathematics is creative like art, especially at the beginning of the semester.    Notes for  This section has a shorter exploration, but establishes many of the early definitions that are needed early in this text. In the exploration, students can use \"matching up\" as a way to identify whether two lengths are the same. As mentioned in the activity, most of the work can be done without using the square root, but I typically find students wanting to use it anyway. One algebraic item that might be discussed here or in the next section is .  Here is an opportunity to discuss how computation and application is only a small part of mathematics. The questions What do I know? and What can I use? and What can I try? should be encouraged as students work. Our toolbox currently contains the three principles on area, our knowledge of arithmetic and area, and the definitions in this section. We will continue to build our toolbox as the course progresses.  Students have very little experience using an index or glossary. They may benefit from having the index of this textbook pointed out to them. Should they be unsure of terminology or notation later in the course, they should be able to locate this infomation quickly via the index.    Notes for  This section is new, but I have experimented with some tasks to develop early mathematical writing skills. I have asked students to write a short paper in which they give me instructions on how to perform a (nonmathematical) task. I've also done an inclass \"jigsaw group activity\" in which groups of students are given different pattern block designs and have to write instructions on how to recreate the design. They then are paired with someone from a different group and attempt to recreate the design from the instructions. Pictures are not allowed in the instructions, but we later discuss how pictures and precise vocabulary would have been helpful.  This section is designed to introduce students to the importance of understanding, explaining, and communicating mathematics as a way of continuing the subject. I normally assign two explanatory papers in the next chapter. In them, I do not force a formal proof-writing style, but I do encourage students to develop their ability to write clearly, to include and discuss diagrams, to use variables instead of specific measurements, to refer previously established principles and facts, and to use implications appropriately. The letter from Sid to Aunt Josephine serves as a sample for students as they write later letters of explanation. Of course, students may choose to write to a client or use a different form of communication.    Notes for  The activity in this section starts easy, but becomes more challenging. Students typically find squares and triangles that have at least one vertical or horizontal side, but may need encouragement to look at the problem differently. In fact, it might be worth noting how triangles with a base of 1 and a height of 2 can look so different.  The vertices of the polygons must be at the geoboard pegs even though you can have rubberbands crossing elsewhere. Eventually, some students will start creating triangles with no vertical or horizontal sides. Encourage them to come up with their own strategies to compute the areas. Answer questions with questions. What are they thinking? What have they tried? My students have expanded my knowledge of what is possible here.  Some semesters, students with a more extensive mathematical background will use more complicated procedures like the Pythagorean theorem and Heron's formula. If the rest of their group is able to participate in the discussion I let them continue. On the other hand, very little mathematics is needed to use the negative space; that is, finding the area of an inner square by subtracting outer triangles from a rectangle. The student who makes this observation often has a confidence boost from sharing this in a post-activity discussion. If it does not appear that anyone in the class is headed in this direction, I have posted a picture of one group's triangle and then drawn the box around it watching students' expressions for a possible \"aha.\" Another time, I started the subsequent class by displaying the following picture and asking students to write what they notice and wonder.   A five by five geoboard with outer vertices connected to form a square with side four. A triangle formed by connecting the vertices (0,2), (3,4), and (4,0).   To my surprise, several students noticed incorrectly that the triangle was isosceles. This led to a worthwhile investigation into how they might convince me that it was isosceles and helping them see why visual claims did not hold.   "

  "body": " Why do the area formulas hold?   In these activities we will determine the area formulas for three shapes, a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be able to explain why they follow from the basic principles. In particular, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle, , as our starting point and derive other area formulas from it.    Area of a Parallelogram   Discovering an Area Formula for a Parallelogram   Refer to the definition of parallogram as needed to complete the following.    Sketch the following:   A parallelogram with two different angle measures and two different lengths.    A parallelogram with a least one acute angle and four congruent sides.    A parallelogram with four congruent angles. What do we usually call this parallelogram?    Two parallelograms which share the same side lengths but have different heights.       Beginning with the parallelogram pictured below or the one you sketched in of , explain and demonstrate how you would construct a rectangle with the same area. You are allowed to cut the parallelogram and rearrange or duplicate pieces as part of your argument.    Building on the previous problem, derive an area formula for a parallelogram. Use a combination of words and pictures to explain how it comes from the area formula for a rectangle and how you know it must work for all parallelograms.   Be sure to label the height and base in your pictures. These lengths should stay the same throughout your explanation and clarify the relationship between your parallelogram and rectangle.    Now that we know the area formula for parallelograms and why it works, we may add it to our toolbox and use it as well as the area formula for a rectangle in the next exploration.    The Area of a Triangle   Discovering the Area Formula for a Triangle   You probably remember the angle formula for a triangle; in fact, you may have used it already in this course! But why is the area ? This exploration will encourage you to answer that question.    Triangles come in all shapes and sizes. Sketch one or more examples of the following types of triangles.   An equilateral triangle.    A right isosceles triangle.    An acute triangle that is not equilateral.    An obtuse scalene triangle.       To demonstrate WHY the formula, , gives the area for any triangle, construct a parallelogram based on the triangle shown below. How is the area of your parallelogram related to the area of the triangle? Explain.   Resist the urge to use numbers instead of the variables, and . Specific triangles will have numerical dimensions, but we want a formula that will work for all triangles, not just the one you have. Variables allow us to generalize formulas.    A scalene triangle.     A friend (or one of your students) asks you why the area formula for a triangle is . Rewrite and elaborate on your answer to the previous task to give a clear, thorough, and cohesive explanation. Be sure to use words and pictures as needed to make the locations of and clear. The relationship between the triangle and the parallelogram needs to be made explicit as well. Do they have the same height and base? Why or why not? Why must their areas be related and how?     The Area of a Trapezoid  We now have three area formulas in our toolbox:   First Three Area Formulas  area of triangle  area of parallelogram  area of rectangle  triangle area  parallelogram area  rectangle area    Shape  Area Formula  Variables    Rectangle   area , length , width    Parallelogram   area , base , height    Triangle   area , base , height     You may use these three formulas in the next exploration as needed.   The Area Formula for a Trapezoid   We now turn to the trapezoid . Once again, we look at some examples before exploring the formula for area.    Sketch example(s) of each of the following trapezoids:   An isosceles trapezoid.    A trapezoid with one right angle.    A trapezoid with one acute base angle and one obtuse base angle.       Use dissection (cutting), duplication, and\/or rearrangement to construct or deconstruct the trapezoid below into one or more rectangles, parallelograms, and\/or triangles. If you found one method, challenge yourself to do this a second way. Perhaps, you can use just triangles or just parallelograms. Briefly describe your construction or deconstruction.   An arbitrary trapezoid, not isosceles and not a right trapezoid.     How does your (de)construction demonstrate that the area formula for a trapezoid is ? The steps that follow will assist you in forming a convincing argument.   Choose one of the constructions or deconstructions you created in the previous task. Label the height of the trapezoid with the variable . The summit and base of the trapezoid are typically labeled and , but you are free to name them and if you would like to avoid subscripts. Once you select your labels, you will use them consistently for the remainder of this activity. In my discussion, I will use and to represent the summit and base.   You could even name the summit or if you desire. On the other hand, is a bit long to use in diagrams and formulas so single letters are usually chosen.     Now identify any parts of your other shapes that must have the same length as your trapezoid's height, base, or summit because of the way they were constructed. Label them with the appropriate variable to indicate this equality. Be careful!    (Skip if this doesn't apply to your (de)construction.) If you created any triangles, rectangles, or parallelograms which have, or might have, different base length or height, you will need to give these lengths new, different labels. If you find that you need to create a lot of new labels, you might want to use a different construction or deconstruction to reduce the amount of algebra you will need to do later.    (Skip if this doesn't apply to your (de)construction.) Relate any new labels to the trapezoid's height, base, and\/or summit. For example, if you split the base into three segments, labeled , , and , you would write down the relationship . If you split the base into two segments, one of which is congruent to the summit, you might write or equivalently, .    Compute the areas of any rectangles, parallelograms, or triangles in your construction\/deconstruction, leaving variables in your expressions for each area. Be careful to use the variables assigned in your sketch which may be different than the variables in the standard formulas. For example, if you created an upside-down triangle, its base may be the summit of the trapezoid, and so we would use the label (or ) instead of .    Write a draft of how your (de)construction shows that the area of any trapezoid must be where is the length of the summit, is the length of the base, and is the height. You may be asked to write this explanation more formally outside of class.         Thoughts on Area  Adding the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we now have four area formulas in our tool box. One could continue to add more: kites, pentagons, hexagons, etc., but the list would become unwieldly and unhelpful. trapezoid area  area of a trapezoid Instead, we will simply break other polygonal shapes into triangles, parallelograms, and other shapes so that we can compute the area of these and add (or subtract) the areas as appropriate. Measuring tools could be used to estimate the dimensions needed to compute the area of physical spaces such as floorspace or a garden.   Estimating the Area of Curved Regions  As our shapes become more irregular or curved, we apply the definition of area together with estimation. For these situations, we may superimpose the region over a grid of -unit squares. Of course, the boundary of the region may cross through some squares as shown below.   A curved region on a grid of 1x1-unit squares   a curved shape over a grid of squares      Estimating Area of a Curved Region   Give a rough estimate of the area of the region sketched in . Briefly describe what you did.   There are many, many right answers for this task!    Count the squares that are completely inside the sketched region. This will give an underestimate of the area.    Give an overestimate of the area by selecting and counting a collection of squares that completely encloses the sketched region.    Carefully add a horizontal line halfway between each pair of horizontal lines on the original grid. Similarly add vertical line between each existing pair of vertical lines. This will produce a more refined grid with smaller squares.   Each square on the original grid had an area of 1 unit. What is the area of each new square that you created?    Count the small squares that are entirely inside the region and use this to compute an underestimate of the region.   You may choose to use a mix of original and smaller squares as long as they do not overlap.     Give a more refined overestimate of the area of the region by identifying a collection of squares that encloses the region.       Briefly describe how this method can be used to measure the area of any region to a desired level of precision. What are some limitations to this method?      The Area of a Circle  Although a circle is not a polygon, we include the formula for its area here. In fact, Archimedes (287-212 BC) determined the area of a circle by looking at inscribed and circumscribed polygons. As the number of sides grew, the area of the polygons would approach the area of the circle, with the area of the inscribed polygons giving a lower estimate and the area of the circumscribed polygons giving an overestimate. The number was not known at the time, but this method provides a means of calculating to any level of precision. Note that . The value is only a rough estimate. In fact, mathematicians have now calculated over sixty trillion digits for . For our purposes, should be sufficient, but space travel engineers usually need about 40 digits of for their work.   Inscribing and circumscribing a circle with squares, octagons, and 16-gons.   Three pictures of the same circle. The first has a square inside with vertices touching the circle and a square outside with the sides' midpoints touching the circle. The second circle has an octagon with vertices on the circle and a larger octagon with its sides' midpoints touching the circle. The final picture has a pair of 16-gons that are almost indistinguishable from the circle between them.    There are two measurements associated with a circle. In addition to area which measures the interior space, we often wish to compute the length of the boundary around the circle. We call this boundary length, the circumference of the circle and can think of it as the length of string needed to wrap around the circle. Both area and circumference depend only on the length of the circle's radius .  A technique, similar to the one described for estimating area using polygons of increasing number of sides, can be used to find the circumference or distance around a circle. We give the resulting formula below.   Defining a Circle  circle  radius  diameter  center circle   A circle is the set of all points that are the same distance from a point called the center of the circle. The radius (pl. radii) refers both to any segment from the center of the circle to a point on the circle and to the length common to all radii. A segment that joins two points of the circle and passes through the center is called a diameter . The length of a diameter is also called the diameter and is twice the length of the radius.    The con   Measuring a circle  circumference  circle circumference  circle area  area circle   The area of a circle is the interior space of a circle and is computed by the formula where is the radius of the circle.

  "title": "Exploring Angle Measure",
  "body": " Exploring Angle Measure   How Can We Measure Angles  Having looked at area as the measure of the interior space of a polygon, we now turn our attention to measuring angles. What is an angle and how do we measure it? To fully grasp the definition of angle, we need to first understand the difference between lines, segments, and rays.   line  segment  line segment  distance  length    line     line segment     length of segment     length of segment    A line is a one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in opposite directions. In Euclidean geometry, lines are straight, but we will encounter a geometry in which they are curved. One important trait of lines is that any pair of distinct points lie on exactly one line. For this reason, we may denote the line through points and as .  A line segment is the part of a line described by two endpoints. Line segment consists of endpoints  and and all points on line which lie between and .  Unlike a line, a line segment has finite length. We define the length of to be the distance from point to point . We use the notation or simply to denote the length of .     ray    ray     Ray  consists of point , point , and all points on line which are on the same side of as point . A ray extends infinitely in one direction, has a single endpoint, and cannot be measured.     angle  vertex angle  angle vertex  angle side  side angle   An angle is the union of two rays with a common endpoint. In particular, consists of all points that lie on the rays and . The common endpoint of the rays is called the vertex of the angle and the two rays and are called the sides of the angle.    To think of the measure of an angle as the space between the rays is vague and misleading. The area between the rays is infinite. Note also that the points and on the sides of do not play a role in defining or measuring the angle. If is any other point on ray other than , then is the same angle as and hence have the same measure. Thus it would make no sense to use the linear distance between and for measuring . The sides of an angle are infinite and beyond what can be drawn.  Instead, we think of angle measurement in terms of rotational movement around the vertex, specifically the amount of rotation needed to move one side of the angle on top of the other.   To begin our study of angle measure, we will adopt the practice of assuming that there are 360 degrees in a full rotation about any point. The choice of 360 can be traced back to the Babylonians who were studying planetory paths around 400 B.C. and used a base 60 (instead of base 10) number system. One advantage of the number 360 is that it has a lot of factors, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.    Full rotation about point .   A circle centered around point A. An arrow has been added to the circle to indicate rotation in a counterclockwise direction.        180-degree rotation about point   Line containing C A and B from left to right. Semicircular arc drawn with center A from point B to the line on the opposite side of A.    Suppose point lies between points and on line . In this case, we say that rays and are opposite rays opposite rays  rays opposite . Since , a rotation of 180 degrees will take the ray to the ray on the opposite side of .    Continuing, we define the measurement of angles according to what fraction of a full (or half) rotation they represent. Notice how the protractor divides the semicircular arc into 180 segments, eighteen of which are labeled with numerical values. These are multiples of ten, representing of the half-rotation 180 degrees. To find the measure of , we place the center dot of the protractor over the vertex of the angle and lined up ray with the mark for 0 degrees. The other side of the angle passes through the mark for 40 degrees.   Using a protractor to measure angles.   A protractor aligned with line containing C A B, centered at point A. Labels for every multiple of 10 degrees from zero degrees up through 180 degrees are shown, both clockwise and counterclockwise. Ray AD passes through the indicator for 40 degrees.      Reading a Protractor  Use the picture above to determine the following:   The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .        What fraction of a full rotation is 40 degrees?    What fraction of a full rotation is 110 degrees?     Use a physical protractor and a ruler to draw an angle with measure 78 degrees. Describe your technique.  It is possible to have angle measures greater than 180 degrees. Use words and\/or pictures to describe an angle that measures 240 degrees.   We give a more concise definition of angle measure and introduce the notion of angle congruence.   angle measure  measure angle    angle measure    The measure of , written , is the number of degrees of rotation about vertex needed to move ray onto .     congruent angles    congruent angles    If two angles and have the same measure, we say that the angles are congruent and write . Thus, means .     Note the use of the equals sign in where the two sides of the equation represent numbers. The symbol relates geometrical objects of the same type.     Angles of a Triangle    The GeoGebra app, Angles of a Triangle is useful in completing this activity. You may also perform this activity by carefully cutting out a scalene triangle and tracing it on a sheet of paper.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for Triangle Sum Exploration.      Rotate triangle 180 degrees about the midpoint of side (see hint). Both the original triangle and the rotated version should be visible. What do you notice?  Note that two of the points are double labeled, once for each triangle. If you rightclick on the label, you can move it to make the original label visible.   To perform this rotation in the GeoGebra app, click on the angle rotation icon in the toolbar. Next, click on the interior of the triangle to select the object to be rotated, then click on midpoint to identify the center of the rotation. When prompted to input the angle measure, replace 45 with 180. Then click OK.    Also rotate 180 degrees about the midpoint of side .   Which angle of is congruent to ?    Which angle of is congruent to ?       What does this tell you about ? Explain how the picture shows this.    Make a claim about the sum of the interior angles of a triangle.  Does your work for all triangles or just the one in the picture? To test this in the GeoGebra applet, select the arrow in the tool menu. Then click and drag one of the vertices in the original triangle to change the shape. Do your claims still hold?   Geogebra makes exploring multiple possibilities easier. If you are doing this activity with paper triangles, experiment with other triangles, repeating the previous tasks. If your classmates used different triangles, this would be a good time to compare results.       Additivity of Angles and Definitions Associated with Angles  In this section, you have likely been assuming the additivity of angle measure. Like the additivity of area and length , this is intuitively obvious and will prove useful. We state this as a principle and add it to our toolbox. First, we must clarify what we mean by the interior of an angle.   interior angle  angle interior   A point is said to be in the interior of if lies between points and on line segment .     Additivity of Angle Measure   If ray lies in the interior of angle , then .         Vertical Angles  To conclude this section, we will use what we have learned to make a claim about vertical angles.   angle vertical  vertical angle   When a pair of lines intersect, each pair of opposite angles formed by the intersection are said to be a pair of vertical angles . Vertical angles share a common vertex, namely the point of intersection, and the sides of one angle will be the opposite rays of the sides of the other angle.      Determine two pairs of vertical angles in the figure to the right.   Lines intersecting to form vertical angles   Two lines meet at point E. One line contains points A, E, and B in order and the other contains points C, E, and D in that order.      Each pair of vertical angles consists of two angles.   One pair consists of and . The other pair of vertical angles are and .    What must be true about the measures of any pair of vertical angles? Give a thorough explanation of why this must be true using Principle .

  "title": "What does Parallel Mean?",
  "body": " What does Parallel Mean?   What does it mean for two lines to be parallel? Remembering that lines continue indefinitely, we define two lines in the same plane to be  parallel if they never intersect. In this section, we will look more closely at this definition, explore properties related to parallel lines, and explore what lines look like in other geometries.    Geometry on Another Surface  In school, we typically consider lines to lie on a flat surface called a plane. While most of this textbook will follow this tradition, we take a brief departure from planar geometry in this section. The world we live on is not flat; it is roughly spherical. What objects might act like lines on the surface of a sphere. Do spherical lines have the same properties as lines on a plane? One could also study the behavior of lines in our universe: Are they straight or do the bend? What can we say about parallel lines in these environments? Do our familiar properties hold?   Defining Lines on a Sphere   For this activity and the one that follows, you will need a sphere, some rubber bands large enough to go around your sphere, a protractor, a marker, and a piece of thread. Possible spheres include styrophone balls, oranges, rubber softballs, or spheres sold by math education supply companies. Aim for a sphere around the size of a softball or larger. As an alternative, you may use a globe with latitude and longitude lines marked. This latter option requires some string or ribbon instead of rubber bands and markers.    In your own words, write three different endings to the statement, A line is ... . Compare your responses to that of your classmates.    Complete the following sentences:   The sum of the measures of the interior angles of any triangle is ...    Two lines in the plane are parallel if ...       We don’t live on a plane; we live on a sphere. Let’s predict what the lines on a sphere, on our earth, might be. The lines will lie on the surface of the sphere. The lines will not pass through the sphere nor will they project out into space. What are some examples of things that might pose as “lines” on a sphere? Which of your descriptions in do they satisfy?    You’ve probably heard the expression, The shortest distance between two points lies along a line. We shall use this property of line segment to determine which linear features on a sphere act as lines and line segments. Suppose you’re planning to fly from Chicago, Illinois (41.8781N, 87.6298W), to Rome, Italy (41.9028N,12.4964E). There are many paths you could take, many of which might qualify as lines under your suggestions above. Which of these gives the shortest distance from Chicago to Rome? If a globe is available, find Chicago and Rome and experiment with a string to find the path of least distance. If you do not have a globe, mark the approximate locations of Chicago and Rome on your sphere; each should be midway between the equator and the north pole, with Rome approximately a quarter of the way around east of Chicago. Tighten the string connecting these two cities to observe the path of shortest distance between them.   Describe this line segment. Does it follow a latitude line? Bend toward the north pole? Bend toward the equator?    Allow the “line” to extend “forever” beyond the two points. What figure does it form? How is this figure related to the sphere itself?      The geogebra app www.geogebra.org\/m\/j4yqa9jd , authored by Heather Pierce, may also be used to draw lines on a virtual sphere.     The lines on a sphere are simply the great circles of the spheres. A great circle is a circle on a sphere that has the same diameter as the sphere itself. If you were to cut a sphere along a great circle, you would split the circle into two hemispheres of the same size. Restrict yourself to this definition of line for the next exploration.   Properties of Spherical Lines and Triangles    Which latitudes will be lines (great circles) on a sphere?    Which longitudes will be lines on a sphere according to this definition?    Choose any point not on the equator. Can you construct a line through this point that is parallel to the equator? Explain.    What do you expect to be true about the sum of the interior triangles of your spherical triangle? Plot three noncollinear points on your sphere and connect them with spherical line segments (rubber bands).    To measure the angles on a sphere, pass a piece of thread through the vertex hole of a protractor and tie it securely. Hold the protractor with that hole at the vertex of the angle you wish to measure, aligning the baseline of the protractor with one side of the angle. By pulling the thread tight and visually aligning it with the second side of the angle, you should be able to read the measure on the protractor. Record the measurements of each of the three angles of your triangle and then add the three measures.   Angle A:    Angle B:    Angle C:    Sum:       Repeat the last tasks two more times so that you have found the sum of the measures of the angles for three different triangles. Record your measurements and sums. What do you notice?   You should find that spherical triangles behave differently from triangles in the plane.    What is the largest triangle you can make on the sphere? Describe it and then determine the sum of its interior angles.   You get to define largest here and your definition may differ from that of other classmates. Hence, your results may also differ!    Make a conjecture as to the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a spherical triangle. Test your conjecture with additional triangles.      Understanding Parallel Lines  The two explorations, and led to some observations that might have surprised you. One of the ways in which spherical geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that no lines on the sphere are parallel. Of course, we could have defined line differently, but that would have led to a loss of other properties of lines, such as the existence and uniqueness of a line joining any pair of points. Hence, we need to be clear regarding the geometry we are working with. Except where specified, our study will be limited to Euclidean geometry where lines lie on planes, not spheres. In Euclidean geometry, parallel lines do exist; in fact, for each point and line not passing through that point, we can always draw exactly one line that is parallel to the given line and passes through the given point. We will accept this statement, known as Playfair's Parallel Postulate, as one of our principles.    Playfair's Parallel Postulate   Given a line and a point not on , there is one and only one line passing through and parallel to .    In order to be parallel, two lines must lie in the same plane. If you are reading this indoors, you probably have a wall in front of you and a wall somewhere to your right. The line where the ceiling meets the wall in front of you will never intersect the line formed by the intersection of the floor and the wall to your right. Still, we do not consider these two lines to be parallel because there is no plane containing both lines. Instead, we say that these are skew lines .   Illustrating skew lines as edges on a rectangular room.   Rectangular box: front face has vertices A, B, C, and D counterclockwise starting in lower left corner. On the back face, the verices G, H, F, and E are counterclockwise starting in lower left, so that edges AG, BH, CF, and DE join the front and back faces.    Check your Understanding  Refer to as you answer the following.   In the figure, it looks like and should intersect. Explain why they do not intersect when we think of the figure as a three-dimensional rectangular box or room.    Identify a second line (extension of an edge of the box in the picture) that would be considered to be skew to .    How many lines suggested by edges of this box are parallel to ? Name them.      We also observed that angle measures in spherical triangles did not behave in the way that Euclidean triangles do. This suggests that the measures of angles may be related to the parallel postulate. Indeed the two concepts are closely connected. In section , we rotated a triangle 180 degrees about a midpoint of one of its sides and again around the midpoint of a second side and noticed that copies of the three angles formed a line when placed side by side at a vertex. We now look at that exploration in the context of parallelism.   Alternate Interior Angles   In the following application, triangle has been rotated 180 degrees about midpoint of side to form . Note that point coincides with and point coincides with .   An interactive Geogebra applet for Exploration on Alternate Interior Angles.       What appears to be true about lines and ?    What other two lines appear to have this property?    Verify your observation by using the parallel line tool in the app. After selecting parallel lines from the line tool menu, click on the line segment it should be parallel to and then click on the point it should pass through.       What can we say about the relationship between angles and    In terms of angle measure? How do you know?   An angle measurement tool is provided in the app if you choose to use it. Click on the three points defining the angle in counterclockwise order with the vertex of the angle being the second of the three. You may be able to give an explanation that does not use actual measurement.     In terms of their relationship to the parallel lines, and and the line ?    In terms of triangle and its copy ?       When a line cuts across two other lines, we call it a transversal of the lines. When a transversal cuts across two parallel lines and so that points and are on opposite sides of , angles and are said to be alternate interior angles . We will not give a proof, the following two statements are equivalent to Playfair's Parallel Postulate. They hold in Euclidean geometry where Playfair's Parallel Postulate is assumed, but fail in non-Euclidean geometries like Spherical Geometry in and .   Corresponding Angles   Given two parallel lines and and a line that crosses and , corresponding angles have the same angle measure.

  "body": " Exploring Regular Polygons   Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings can be used to tile the plane.   The material in this section has been adapted from Section 4.1 in Symmetry, Shape, and Space .     Regular Polygons  We begin by defining what it means for a polygon to be regular.   regular polygon  polygon regular   A polygon is a regular polygon if all of its sides and all of its angles are congruent.     Check Your Understanding!  Explain why each shape below is not a regular polygon:   Nonregular Polygons    Rhombus ABCD with obtuse angles at B and D, Rectangle EFGH with height 6 and width 10, and a House-shaped pentagon with base length 4, wall height 4, and total height 6.        Regular Tilings  In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominoes. In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.   tiling  tiling regular  regular tiling  tiling monohedral  monohedral tiling   A tiling is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no gaps and no overlaps. A monohedral tiling is tiling that uses only one shape, a regular tiling is a monohedral tiling using a single regular polygon as its tile. In a regular tiling, each side of a polygon will line up perfectly with a side of an adjacent copy.     Regular Tilings   This activity may be completed using physical tiles or in an app. Be sure to save a record of your designs by tracing, photography, or screenshots. Some of the computations will also be used later in this section. You are encourage to keep an accessible record of your work for future reference.  The web application Polypad by Mathigon provides regular -gons for . These are the top six shapes in the Polygons and Shapes menu. Simply drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area. Rotate using the black dot and move by clicking on the interior. For -gons with , use the hexagon labeled \"regular\" in the bottom rom of shapes. After you have moved this figure into the whiteboard, use the dotted vertex to increase the number of sides. You can then use the duplicated sheet icon on the flip\/cut\/... menu to make copies of your -gon.     Select a single regular polygon, making copies of it as needed, and use it to construct a regular tiling. Construct enough of the tiling to convince others that the tiling can continue to tile the plane with no gaps and overlaps.    Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, regular hexagons, and other regular -gons to determine which can be used to create a regular tiling and which do not. What do you think will happen with regular polygons with more than eight sides? Why?    Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure places a role in determining whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. This task will lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other regular n-gons.    A triangulated regular pentagon   A regular pentagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The interior angle at A has been split by diagonals into angles 1, 2, and 3. Angle D has been split into angles 4 and 5. Angle C has been split into angles 6 and 7.                            , etc.        Explain why     What is ?    Use the fact that the pentagon is divided into triangles to determine .    Having just computed the sum of the five congruent angles of a regular pentagon, determine .    Some of what you found, but not all, will be true for all convex pentagons. What results about angle measure will also hold for non-regular convex pentagons? What will be different?       Use your work from the previous task to complete the row for regular pentagon in the table below. Repeat this procedure for squares, regular hexagons, regular octagons, and regular decagons, drawing diagonals from a single vertex to dissect the polygon into triangles, using the triangles to determine the total vertex angle measure, and then determining the measure of each angle. In the final row, is a variable representing the number of sides and the answers will be algebraic expressions involving the variable .

How many squares can meet at a single point?    How many regular hexagons can meet at a single point?    Explain in words and pictures why these three regular polygons can each produce a regular tiling.    When we tried to surround a point with regular pentagons a gap was formed. What is the degree measure of that gap?    If , do you know whether a regular -gon might produce a regular tiling? Include a discussion of vertex angle measure in your explanation.         Semiregular Tilings  If we allow more than one regular polygon to be used in a tiling, we may are able to create a wider variety of designs.   tiling semiregular  semiregular tiling  tiling monohedral  vertex arrangement tiling   A semiregular tiling is a tiling consisting of two or more regular polygon with common side lengths with the additional requirement that the arrangement of polygons around each vertex is the same.  We can denote the vertex arrangement by identifying the number of sides in each polygon as we travel around a vertex. An example of this is 3.3.4.3.4 (triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square) which will be encountered in the next exploration.     In Search of Semiregular Tilings   Once again, you are encouraged to continue the practice of saving your sketches, work, and results as they may be useful later in this section.    What must be true about the measures of the angles of the vertices meeting at and surrounding a single point?   The sum of the angle measures must be 360 degrees.    In , you determined the vertex angle measure for a few regular polygons and developed a general formula for finding this measure. Use the formula, to determine the vertex angle measure of each of the following regular -gons. If the answer is not a whole number, write the answer as a mixed number.   heptagon (7 sides)    nonagon (9 sides)    dodecagon (12 sides)    pentakaidecagon (15 sides)    octakaidecagon (18 sides)    icosagon (20 sides)    tetrakaicosaigon (24 sides)    tetracontakaidigon (42 sides)      The measure of the vertex angle of a regular -gon is given by the formula .      A 3.3.4.3.4 vertex arrangement.   (for accessibility)    The vertex arrangement pictured is denoted (triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square).      Verify that the sum of the angles meeting at the vertex is 360 degrees.    Extend the design making sure that you always have one or two triangles between any two squares. Will this eventually fill the plane without gaps or overlaps?    Note that gives a different pattern. Show that it is possible to create a tiling using the vertex arrangement by building outward from your initial vertex arrangement.       Verify arithmetically that it is possible for an equilateral triangle, a regular heptagon, and a regular tetracontakaidigon (pictured below), to fit snugly around a vertex with no overlaps. In shorthand, we can write this vertex arrangement as .   A tetracontakaidigon (42-gon).   (for accessibility)      Use the angle measures you found in and to list all combinations of three, four, or five regular polygons that could meet at a vertex, writing the vertex configurations in shorthand notation. Like the example in , the same shape may be repeated. If more than three polygons meet at a vertex, consider the different ways in which they could be arranged.   Note that and are potentially two other ways of writing in . We could begin at any polygon and list the polygons in order. To avoid these repetitions, it is standard practice to begin with the polygon with the smallest number of sides and then to move to its neighbor with the smallest number of sides, continuing around until all the polygons around the point have been named. Similarly, we write rather than for the tiling where the two squares are adjacent.    We are not including the three regular tilings in this list. There is one more vertex arrangement using five polygons (in addition to 3.3.4.3.4 and 3.3.3.4.4), five using four polygons, and eight more using three polygons (in addition to 3.7.42).    Some of the vertex arrangements in the previous task will extend to create a semiregular titling, but not all of them! Experiment by surrounding one vertex using the pattern and then try to surround the neighboring vertices using the same arrangement. Which seem to work and which fail? For the ones that fail, what seems to go wrong?   Only eight of the seventeen possible vertex arrangements can be used to create a semiregular tiling.    What do you notice about the vertex arrangements that work (or those that don't work)? What do you wonder?    This activity may have involved more of a struggle that some of the others. Perhaps you only found about half of the possibilities in or you cannot yet see a pattern to help determine which vertex arrangements lead to a semiregular tiling. That is perfectly normal. Write down the ideas that you do have and share them with classmates. As you share what you have observed and listen to others' discoveries, you and your classmates may uncover some amazing results.    Narrowing Down the Options  When we look at possible vertex arrangements for a semiregular tiling, our options are very limited. Not including the regular tiling by squares, you should have found three groups of four regular polygons with an angle sum of 360 degrees. All of these have at least one polygon appearing twice. Why do some of these extend to a semiregular tiling while others do not? Does it matter whether the common polygons are next to each other or separated?  As we attempt to create a 3.3.6.6 pattern, we find that it is impossible to maintain a consistent vertex arrangement. Fairly quickly, we are forced to create a 3.6.3.6 arrangement at some vertices. On the other hand, a 3.3.6.6 vertex arrangement can continue indefinitely. Let us explore why this happens.   Semiregular Tilings with Four Regular Polygons at a Vertex   Use physical or virtual triangles and hexagons to sketch the vertex arrangement 3.3.6.6 or refer to an earlier sketch if available.    Choose one of the two triangles at this vertex and attempt to surround it with triangles and\/or hexagons while adhering to the 3.3.6.6 arrangement.    Note that each triangle in a 3.3.6.6 must share a side with one triangle and one hexagon due to the order of the 3's and 6's.   Surrounding a regular triangle with regular triangles and regular hexagons.    Will the remaining side abut a triangle or a hexagon? Discuss what happens in each case. A GeoGebra interactive of this figure is available at .       There is a second group of four regular polygons consisting of two equilateral triangles and two other polygons.   What are the other two polygons? We will represent the number of sides of these polygons by and .    Explain why the arrangement will not extend to a semiregular tiling using an argument similar to what we did with .    Explain why the arrangement also fails to create a semiregular tiling.       The remaining semiregular tiling with four polygons meeting at each vertex has two squares and two other polygons in the vertex arrangement.   What are the other two polygons? Again, the number of sides of these two polygons are represented by and in the questions that follow.    Are you able to surround a square along its sides by an alternating sequence of -gons and -gons?    One of the polygons has an odd number, , of sides. Are you able to surround the -gon along its sides by an alternating sequence of squares and -gons?    Explain in words and pictures why extends to a semiregular tiling, but does not. Draw a sketch of if you do not already have one.       We conclude that there are only two semiregular tilings and one regular tiling of the plane where four polygons meet at a vertex. All three vertex arrangements with five polygons meeting extend to semiregular tilings. To complete this analysis, we consider which three-polygon vertex arrangements extend to a semiregular tiling.   Semiregular Tilings with Three Regular Polygons at a Vertex   Not including the regular tiling , there are nine possible vertex arrangements consisting of three regular polygons. List as many as you can, referring back to the work you did in .    Verify algebraically that can surround a single point.    Use the fact that 5 is an odd number to explain why does not extend to a semiregular tiling. You may include pictures as well as words in your explanation.    Determine the three vertex arrangements with three polygons that extend to a semiregular tiling. Why must the others be eliminated?      Summary and Tools  As we conclude this long section, it is wise to reflect on what we have learned. What should we add to our tool box for later use? Definitions for regular polygons, tilings, regular tilings, and semiregular tilings were introduced at the beginning of the section. You should also note the items below:  Key Ideas related to Regular Polygons    What formula can be used to compute the angle measure for a regular -gon?    What is the sum of the measures of the vertex angles for any (not-necessarily regular) convex -gon? For example, the measures of the angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees. What is the total for a convex quadrilateral, a convex pentagon, etc.?    Describe the three regular tilings.    If a group of polygons meet at a single vertex, what must be the sum of the angle measures at that vertex? Note that this wording generalizes this fact to nonregular polygons as well.    Just because a collection of regular polygons can surround a vertex does not mean that they can create a semiregular tiling. Give an example of a vertex arrangement that does not extend to a regular tiling. Support your claim.       Exercises   Skills and Recall   Sketch a picture of each of the following:   A rectangle that is a regular quadrilateral.    A rectangle that is not a regular quadrilateral.       What is the total angle measure of each of the following?   a triangle    a convex quadrilateral    a convex 11-gon    a convex 50-gon      (a) 180 degrees, (b) 360 degrees, (c) 1620 degrees, (d) 8640 degrees   (c)     Demonstrate that each of the following exist by sketching an example:   a pentagon that is not convex    a convex hexagon with at least one right angle       Demonstrate that each of the following exist by sketching an example:   an equilateral polygon that is not regular    an equiangular polygon that is not regular       Answer the following:   What is the measure of each vertex in a regular 18-gon?    What is the measure of each vertex in a regular 9-gon?    If a regular 18-gon, a regular 9-gon, and an equilateral triangle meet at a vertex, will there be a gap? an overlap? or will they fit together without gaps or overlaps?   Explain why it is impossible to create a semiregular tiling using regular 18-gons, regular 9-gons, and equilateral triangles.

  "title": "Exploring Length and the Pythagorean Theorem",
  "body": " Exploring Length and the Pythagorean Theorem   Dating from before 500 B.C., the Pythagorean Theorem allows us to compute lengths associated with right triangles. Upon completing this section, you should be able to explain to others how the Pythagorean Theorem follows from our basic principles. First, we introduce some terminology and refresh our memory on how to apply the theorem.    Right Triangles   triangle right  right triangle  hypotenuse  leg right triangle   As noted in , a right triangle is a triangle with one right angle. The longest side, called the hypotenuse , of a right triangle is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides of the right triangle are called the legs .     Check Your Understanding   Refer to the picture as you answer the following:   (for accessibility)     Which lower case letter represents the hypotenuse in the triangle above?        Which angle appears to be the smallest in the triangle?        Which side appears to be the shortest in the triangle?      How are the answers to the last two questions related? Does this relationship also hold for the largest side and largest angle?   The smallest side is opposite the smallest angle. The largest side is opposite the largest angle.      The Pythagorean Theorem  The Pythagorean Theorem states that if and are the lengths of the sides of a right triangle and is the length of the hypotenuse, then .   Pythagorean Theorem   Suppose is a right triangle with right angle at . Let and be the lengths of legs and , respectively, and let be the length of the hypotenuse . Then .    The next set of questions will refresh your skill in using the Pythagorean Theorem to determine missing lengths.   Check your Understanding   A triangle has legs of length 5 and 7. Determine the length of the hypotenuse.        A square has a diagonal of length . Determine the length of the sides.   Since the sides of a square are the same length, use the same letter to represent all of them. How do you create a triangle from a square?          Proving the Pythagorean Theorem with Picture Puzzles  The Pythagorean Theorem is very useful, but it is also somewhat mysterious. Why does the formula work for all right triangles? Surprisingly, there are more than 350 recognized proofs of the Pythagorean. We will look at just a few. In the following exploration, you will rearrange polygons built from a right triangle, and use the rearrangements to explain why in each case. You are encouraged to try all the proofs and to choose one to learn well enough to convince others.   The book, The Pythagorean Proposition, by Elisha S. Loomis, (NCTM:1968) contains 367 proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem.     Puzzling over Why the Pythagorean Theorem Holds   For these explorations, we start with an arbitrary right triangle with hypotenuse length and legs of length and .   First Pythagorean Puzzle  The four triangles on the right are congruent copies of and the square in the upper right has side length .   An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.       Fill the square on the lower left using the four copies of the triangle and the square on the right. Pieces can be moved by selecting the interior and rotated by moving the visible point. Triangle is only shown for reference and will not be used. As always, there should be no gaps nor overlaps. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas still using variables.      Second Pythagorean Puzzle  The four triangles on the right are congruent copies of and the square in the upper right has side length , the length of the shorter leg of the right triangle. The square below it has a side length corresponding to the other leg.    An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.       Fill the square frame on the lower left with the four congruent right triangles and the squares with lengths and , respectively. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas using variables.      Using the First Two Puzzles Together to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem  Look at the two ways in which you filled the square frames and the expressions for the area of the frames. How can you use this to justify the formula ?   An alternative is to use just the first puzzle and more algebra to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. This is acceptable, but Education majors may appreciate that the method of using both puzzles together can be used to convince third graders.    Are the square frames the same size? Why does this allow us to set the two sums of areas equal to each other?   A Presidential Proof  This proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is attributed to James A. Garfield, the twentieth President of the United States. Refer to the diagram below:   Right triangle ABC with right angle at C. Point D is placed on ray CA so that the length of AD equals the length of BC. Point E is placed on the same side of CD as B so that line DE is perpendicular to AD and segment DE is the same length as AC. Points E and B are joined by a segment. This creates two congruent right triangles ABC and EAD and an isoceles right triangle BAE. The outer boundary is a trapezoid BCDE since BC and DE are parallel.      The diagram above consists of two congruent right triangles and one isosceles right triangle arranged to form a trapezoid. Label the hypotenuses with the letter . Label the smallest side of these triangles and the other leg . Note that the hypotenuse of the remaining right triangle is longer than . Instead, call it .    Identify the two parallel bases for the trapezoid. Determine the height of this trapezoid in terms of the labels you put on the diagram.    Compute the area of the trapezoid using the trapezoid formula leaving your answer in terms of the variables you used to label the diagram.    Similarly, compute the areas of each of the three triangular pieces and add them together.    How does this prove the Pythagorean Theorem?       The final proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is primarily visual. Almost no algebra is required. The interactive again provides four copies of a right triangle and a smaller square of unlabeled side length that can be moved and rotated.   An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.       Rearrange the four congruent triangle copies and the small square to form a square. Verify that your shape is definitely a square. Do not use . Drag the centers of shapes to move them and use the labeled corners to rotate. Save a copy of your work.    What is the length of a side of this square?    What is the area of the square you created?    What is the length of a side of the small square in terms of the labels , , and\/or ?    Once again, our goal is to show . Use the same five pieces to create a pair of touching squares of area and . Some puzzle pieces will cover parts of both squares. A second copy of the Geogebra applet is provided below for your use.   An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem, repeated from above.      How do you know that the two squares in your diagram are actually squares and that their side lengths are and , respectively? Base your arguement on the lengths of the triangle sides.    How do these two sketches together show that the Pythagorean Theorem holds?         Reflecting on the Pythagorean Theorem  Most people can state the Pythagorean Theorem and use it to find missing lengths in a right triangle, but in this section you have learned why the theorem holds for all right triangles. We have practiced using variables in our arguments so that our explanation is not just shown for a right triangle with lengths 3, 4, and 5 (or 5, 12, and 13), but for all right triangles. Even so, the fact that we used puzzle pieces enables us to share this knowledge with anyone who has at least a fourth grade knowledge of geometry, area, and square numbers. A few of our proofs did not require the algebraic representation and symbolic manipulation learned in middle or high school.  On the other hand, we need to be careful that we do not try to apply this theorem to non-right triangles. It is possible to create a triangle whose side lengths are 3, 5, and 6, but this triangle will not have a right angle. In fact, the converse of the Pythagorean theorem states that if , , and are sides of a triangle with , then the triangle will have a right angle opposite the side with length . We will not prove this converse OR DO I PUT IT AS AN EXERCISE.    Exercises   Skills and Recall   Add some Pythagorean problems.    Add more Pythagorean problems.     Extending the Concepts   Under construction.  Prove converse of Pythagorean Theorem. Prove that the side opposite the right angle must be the longest side.--How hard is this?

  "body": " Instructor Notes   Notes for  Although students may know the area formulas for a parallelogram and a triangle, they don't necessarily know how they are related and why height is such an important parameter. Students are less likely to know the area of a trapezoid, which is fine since it is rarely used, but this activity enables them to reconstruct the formula. The emphasis in this section is on creativity, justification, and communication, not computation. this can be an opportunity to demonstrate how the use of labels makes it easier to communicate clearly. I typically assign the trapezoid area \"letter\" as one of the two major explanatory papers in the course. The most common dissection created by students involves cutting the trapezoid into a rectangle and two triangles. Unfortunately, this dissection is the hardest one to work with algebraically as it requires breaking the longer base into three parts and introducing two extra variables. After they have completed the inclass activity, I show them the following picture of some possible dissections that previous students have used.   Dissections of Trapezoids      Notes for  Students should have access to a protractor. Not all students will know how to use one correctly. If the protractor has a hole to align with the vertex, that will be useful in measuring spherical angles in section     Notes for   This is a new section and has not been tested in a class. I'm still trying to strike a balance between introducing students to the strange and exciting world of non-Euclidean geometry without overwhelming them with mathematical rigor. I have used some of the activities in worksheet form, but the reading sections are new and may change. I encourage you to try the spherical triangle activity in advance to decide whether physical spheres will work for your class and how to measure angles. Alternatively, you might consider using the geogebra app , authored by Heather Pierce, to have students draw lines and triangles on a virtual sphere.   I am considering adding an exploration of hyperbolic triangles in the exercise section or as an optional subsection.    Notes for  Explorations into regular and semiregular tilings will encourage students to discover the total angle measure of a convex gon, to develop a formula for the vertex angle of a regular gon, and to observe how alternating patterns can continue around even-sided polygons but not odd ones.  For in-class exploration, you may opt to have pattern blocks or stencils available to assemble and trace, but most sets of pattern blocks do not include regular pentagons, regular heptagons, regular octagons, etc. The online application Polypad by Mathigon , provides regular polygons for through and regular -gons can be created using the \"regular\" tile and dragging the dot. Some interactives and images will be included in the exploration activities.  The end of this section, from , can be omitted depending on the level of reasoning and rigor you wish to develop and the interests of your students. There will be an optional section in on semiregular polyhedra that applies what is developed here. In that section, students can also learn and explore the possibilities without delving into the governing rules. Even if you choose to skip this section, you might want to have worked through the following activities or read about the topic to prepare yourself to lead a discussion. I have also used the following explorations as a way to engage fast groups in class discovery while other groups are catching up.  This section also offers the opportunity for further explorations into dual tilings, tilings with nonregular polygons, creating art from regular tilings, and asymmetric tilings. A few of these are suggested in the list of projects at the end of this section. My students have enjoyed hearing about Marjorie Rice, a housewife, mother, and amateur mathematician who famously discovered new pentagonal tiles. As you look at other resources, note that the terms tiling and tessellation are used interchangeably.  The web application Polypad by Mathigon provides regular -gons for . These are the top six shapes in the Polygons and Shapes menu. Simply drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area. Rotate using the black dot and move by clicking on the interior. For -gons with , use the hexagon labeled \"regular\" in the bottom rom of shapes. After you have moved this figure into the whiteboard, use the dotted vertex to increase the number of sides. You can then use the duplicated sheet icon on the flip\/cut\/... menu to make copies of your -gon.    Notes for  To be added. I assign an explanatory letter on the Pythagorean theorem. I need to go back and fix some of the puzzles. Because three of the blue copies of triangles are duplicates of the first, they do not expand if you change the shape of , but the first triangle does. Until this is fixed, encourage students not to touch . They can use the reset icon or Ctrl-Z to go back if a student does this. They can also refresh the webpage and it will go back to the original. It should stay on the same page.   "

  "body": " Regular Polyhedra   Defining Regular Polyhedra  In this section, we define the term regular polyhedron and identify all of the regular polyhedra that can be created. These special solids appear in ancient art work, were delineated by Greek mathematicians around 300 B.C., and are used to model chemical and biological structures today. We will find that only there are only a handful of regular polyhedra.   regular polyhedron  polyhedron regular   A polyhedron is said to be regular if it satisfies these two conditions:   The faces are congruent regular polygons and    At every vertex, the number of polygons meeting is the same.         What Regular Polyhedra Exist   Discovering Regular Polyhedra   Explain why a square pyramid is not a regular polyhedron.   Reread the definition for regular polyhedron.      In , we found the sum of the measures of the angles surrounding a vertex was always the same. What was that sum?  Why must the total degree of the angles surrounding a vertex be less than that amount if we are building a polyhedron?     Look at some polyhedra or attempt to build some.

Equilateral triangles for building polyhedra may also be created from straws and string. Side length of at least two inches is recommended.  Which regular polyhedra can be formed using equilateral triangles? To answer this question, we will consider the possible number of triangles that could meet at each vertex and attempt to construct the polyhedron, making sure that we keep the vertex arrangement consistent.

We now explore whether we can form regular polyhedra using squares, regular pentagons, or other regular polygons.   Regular polyhedra with square faces:   Each angle of a square has what degree measure?    Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using only squares? If so, determine the number of squares that must meet at each vertex and then construct the polyhedron. Carefully describe this polyhedron and\/or save a picture.

Would it be possible to create a regular polyhedron with fewer squares meeting at each vertex? Why or why not?    Would it be possible to create a regular polyhedron with more squares meeting at each vertex? Why or why not?       Regular polyhedra with pentagonal faces:   What is the measure of a vertex angle of a regular pentagon?    Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using only pentagons?

  "body": " Prisms and Cylinders   Definitions  Let us explore the geometric solid known as a prism in greater detail. As noted in , a prism is a box-like geometric solid with a pair of congruent and parallel polygonal faces, the base and the summit, joined by a band of parallelograms. The number of parallelograms connecting the bases will always equal the number of sides of a base.  We are most familiar with right prisms , namely prisms where the bases meet all the side faces at right angles; the side faces of a right prism are rectangles. An oblique prism is a prism with at least one side face is not a rectangle. right prism  oblique prism  prism oblique  prism right    Right and Oblique Prisms    Right Prism   A rectangular box.     Oblique Prism      Although a cylinder is not a polyhedron since it has a circular base, we will see that there are some similarities between prisms and cylinders. Both have parallel, congruent bases.   Right and Oblique Cylinders    Right Cylinder   A cylinder or can.     Oblique Cylinder   A can that is oblique.      Check your understanding  Besides the parallel circles, what other shape(s) is needed to form the boundary of a cylinder? How many of these shapes are there?   Cut out pieces of paper to cover a cylindrical can. In addition to the two circles, what else do you need?   The two circles are joined by a single rectangle. The width of this rectangle equals the circumference of a circular end.   An important measurement for prisms and cylinders is the distance between the bases. Many geometry textbooks use the term height to describe this distance.   height prism  stretch   The height of a prism or cylinder is the distance between the parallel congruent bases and is measured along a line perpendicular to the bases. When a prism or cylinder is sitting on a side other than a base, the height will be measured laterally instead of vertically. In fact, this text will use the word stretch in lieu of height where confusion may occur.  The height or stretch of a right prism is usually measured along an edge of one of the rectangular sides, like in . The stretch of a skew prism, on the other hand, will be less than the height of a side face as illustrated in .      Volumes of Prisms and Cylinders  In this exploration, we develop learn how to measure the space inside of a prism or pyramid. Hopefully, exploring the meaning of volume will help you appreciate and remember how to find volume.   What is Volume   Suppose you have a box (right rectangular prism) that has a height (or stretch) of 6 inches, a length of 5 inches, and a width of 7 inches and you have a large supply of -cubes.   If you cover the bottom of the inside of the box with a single layer of -cubes, how many cubes will fit in this first layer?    How many horizontal layers of -cubes could you fit in the box? Would each of these layers contain the same number of cubes as the first layer?    What is the total number of 1”x1”x1”-cubes that could fit in the box?       Explain why the formula for the volume of a rectangular box is where is the height, is the width, and is the height of the box.    When is a whole number, it makes sense to think about the height as the number of layers. Not all measurements are whole numbers though. Instead we can think of as the amount that we need to stretch that first layer to reach the summit of the prism. Suppose that our rectangular prism has the dimensions, inches, inches, and a stretch of inches. Find the volume of the prism.   Here you may be imagining two layers with a half layer on top of them. The half cubes ( -cubes on the top layer can be paired to create full -cubes.     This notion of stretching the bottom layer holds for all prisms and cylinders, not just rectangular ones. Suppose a cylinder has a circular base with area 9.4 square centimeters.  If the cylinder is one centimeter tall, what is the volume of the cylinder?  If the cylinder is two centimeters tall, what is the volume?  If the cylinder is five centimeters tall, what is the volume?  If the cylinder is 7.5 centimeters tall, what is the volume?  If the cylinder is centimeters tall, what is volume?      Exploration showed that the the volume of a prism or cylinder was equal to the area of the base times the number of horizontal layers. While you may be used to the formula , this formula only works for rectangular prisms. Instead, note that this formula is equivalent to the formula where is the area of one base of a rectangular prism and is the distance between the bases, measured perpendicular to the bases. This volume formula will extend to ALL prisms and even cylinders! Much less to memorize! We only need to compute the area of the base and then multiply the area by the distance between the bases.

Groups who do succeed in this construction tend to be proud of their accomplishment and allow other groups to use their construction for counting faces, edges, and vertices.  I have made tagboard pieces available in my classes, especially for . These have been less popular, perhaps due to the small size of the triangles and need for tape. In the next section, it is essential that the side length of each polygon be the same.  An alternative for this exploration would be to provide nets for polyhedra after students have discovered the number and types of regular polygons that can fit around a vertex. This is especially true for the icosahedron and the dodecahedron.  It is possible to use combinatorics to count edges and vertices. Some students who may struggle with counting visually may appreciate a suggestion to try this. Eventually, I hope to add homework problems encouraging this technique.

Key Ideas regarding Reflections  In this section, we have drawn reflections by hand using a coordinate grid as an aid and we observed a few of the properties of reflections.

The reflecting line is called the mirror or axis . The image of a point under a reflection (or any other transformation) is the point that the transformation sends to; in this case, the reflection of point .    While the notion of reflecting can be intuitively understood as flipping, the properties you discovered in provide a more specific definition that can be extended to other geometries. These properties are identified in and should be added to your toolbox.  Properties of a Reflecting Line  The reflecting line meets the segment , connecting a point and its reflected image , at a -degree angle. The point where meets is between points and .   90; halfway   So far, we have only reflected across lines that were either horizontal, vertical, or which make a 45-degree angle to the horizontal. As we expand our consideration to reflections across other lines, we will drop the coordinate grid and use technology.   "

  "body": " Orientation-Maintaining Isometries   What do we mean by orientation-maintaining?  The picture shows a triangle reflected across a line . Although the letters , , and are in alphabetical order when read clockwise from the original figure, the letters in the reflected image are in the reverse order. When this happens, we say that the transformation reverses orientation . Any reflection will be an orientation-reversing transformation.   A reflection reverses orientation   Triangle ABC reflected across a line m to create triangle C'B'A'.    Not all transformations change orientation. In this section, you will encounter two types of orientation-maintaining transformations, namely rotations and translations. When an orientation-maintaining transformation is performed, the order in which the vertices are read is unchanged.   Many textbooks use orientation-reversing and orientation-preserving . Because of similarity in the words, reversing and preserving, I have chosen to use the term orientation-maintaining instead of orientation-preserving.    orientation  change orientation  reverse orientation  preserve orientation  maintain orientation  same orientation   A geometrical transformation is said to maintain orientation if when it acts on any polygon the order of the vertices of the resulting image, read in clockwise order, are the same as that of the original figure. Another term for orientation-maintaining is orientation-preserving .  On the other hand, if the resulting images have the vertices in the reverse order, we say that the transformation reverses orientation .      Collinearities and Isomorphisms  We observed that although reflections reverse orientation, they preserve distance, angle measure, and shape; any object and its image under a reflection are congruent. In , we see the action of the reflection across line not just on triangle , but on other points on the plane. Note how points and lie on and their reflected images and lie on the image of . This suggests that this reflection, and in fact any reflection, should preserve linearity of points.   Action of a Reflection      A transformation that preserves linearity, that takes collinear points to collinear points, is called a collineation . preserves linearity  collineation      directs our attention to some qualities preserved by a reflection. As you encounter other collineations you are encouraged to check whether these properties continue to hold.   Properties Preserved by a Reflection   Give examples in that illustrate each of the following properties preserved by the reflection. In some cases, there may be more than one answer.   A point in the interior of a polygon maps to a point in the interior of the image of the polygon.    A point in the exterior of a polygon maps to a point in the exterior of the image of the polygon.    If a point is between two other points on a line, then its image will also lie between the images of those two points.    Points on the right side of the mirror will reflect to a point on the left side of the mirror.    Distance between points is preserved.    Angle measure is preserved.    The image of a point maps reflects back to the original point.       Let be the point where lines and intersect. Where must , the image of be located? Why?    The transformation in is a collineation, but it does not preserve distance. For the remainder of we will focus on distance-preserving collineations. Collineations that do not preserve distance will be the focus of .   isomorphism  distance-preserving  collineation distance-preserving   A collineation is called an isomorphism if it preserves distance between points. In other words, is an isomorphism if for every two points and , where and .    Reflections are just one example of an isomorphism. We shall see that translations and rotations also preserve linearity and distance.    Translations  The first orientation-maintaining transformation is called a translation or slide .   translation  vector  translation vector   A translation is an transformation that slides every point on the plane a fixed distance in a specified direction. The direction and distance are often given in the form of a directed line segment called the translation vector .     Translating on a Coordinate Plane   This exploration may also be done on paper using a print copy of instead of the application.     gives a picture of quadrilateral a vector on a coordinate grid. Vector goes from to suggesting that this translation moves points three units to the right and one unit down.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for translating by a coordinate vector.       Use the point tool to locate and mark the image created by moving point by vector . What are the coordinates of ?   GeoGebra will assign a new name, perhaps , to the point you create. If you would like to rename it, right click on the point and select rename.     Create , , and in a similar fashion, recording their coordinates. Then use the polygon tool to draw quadrilateral .       Does the transformation mapping to preserve distance? In other words, is the length of each side of quadrilateral equal to its corresponding side in quadrilateral ?    Are the corresponding angles of and congruent?    Is the orientation of quadrilateral maintained under the translation? How do you know?    Sketch the segments , , , and .   What do you notice about the lengths of these segments?    What appears to be true about the lines , , , and ?      Since lines have infinite length, you should be looking for a property other than length.    Are the quadrilaterals and congruent?   What type of quadrilateral is ? How do you know? Can the same be said of quadrilaterals , , and ?   An isometry affects all points in the plane, not just those pictured. Draw three new points: point lying on side , point lying in the exterior of quadrilateral , and point lying in the interior of .   Sketch point , the image of under the transformation that takes to . How is the location of related to ?    Sketch point , the image of under the transformation that takes to . How is the location of related to ?    Sketch point the image of under the transformation that takes to . How is the location of related to ?       We call the isometry in a translation . Describe in your own words how a translation acts on points in the plane.     Properties of Translations  In , we observed many of the properties of a transformation called a translation . translation Each translation is uniquely defined by a translation vector A vector is simply a directed line segment between two points. which indicates the direction and distance that every point is moved by the translation. The choice of the translation vector, on the other hand, is not unique. Any vector of the same length which points in the same direction may serve as the vector for the translation. In , the vector is a translation vector for the given translation; however, , , , or even your would describe the same translation. Any of these vectors may be chosen as the translation vector for this translation. You probably noticed that these vectors were parallel and had the same length.     Rotations   The third transformation we will consider is a rotation . Like a translation, a rotation maintains the orientation of the vertices. As the name suggests, a rotation spins the points of a plane around a single fixed point.   rotation  center of a rotation  angle of rotation   A rotation is a transformation of points on a plane that has a single point, called the center of the rotation, which is not moved by the rotation. All other points are rotated around the center a specific number of degrees. This specified number of degrees is referred to as the angle of rotation .    Note that we also need to specify the direction of the spin. If the direction of a rotation is not specified, we will assume that it spins in the counter-clockwise direction. To indicate a clockwise rotation, the angle may be given as a negative number.    Exploring a Rotation    shows an example of the action of a translation on triangle . Use this figure to answer the following:   A rotation of   Triangle ABC is rotated around a point F to form triangle A'B'C'.      List the vertices of the original triangle clockwise order starting with . List the vertices of the image in clockwise order starting with . Does the rotation maintain the orientation of the triangle?    What point in is the center of this particular rotation? Is it on either triangle, in the interior of either triangle, or in the exterior of both triangles? How do you know that the point you identified as the center meets the criteria in the definition of center of rotation ?    Is the rotation distance-preserving? How do you know?    In , the following angle measures are given: Determine the following angle measures:                     What is the degree measure of the rotational angle of this rotation? Is it a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation?     Properties of Rotations  A rotation is specified by two pieces of information, namely its center and the angle of rotation. The center is the one point which does not move. Each other point is moved to a new point . The distance between the center and each point does not change under the rotation, but the direction from the center to each point is changed according to the rotation angle.  The angle of rotation is given by the angle where is the center of the rotation. A positive rotation moves each point to its image in the counterclockwise direction. On the other hand, a rotational angle with negative degree measure would move the image clockwise around the center. Rotational angles may be greater than 180 degrees or negative; in fact, any number of degrees is allowed!  Check your understanding  What is the degree measure of the rotational angle of a clockwise rotation that is identical to a 123-degree counterclockwise rotation? Give two answers, one that is a negative number and other a positive number.      "

  "title": "Identifying Isometries",
  "body": " Identifying Isometries   What do we know? What do we wonder?   As we continue to build on our knowledge of isometries, it is wise to summarize what we know so far. We know that a transformation of a plane is a mapping or function that sends each point on the plane to a unique point called its image under the transformation. Some transformations are collineations , meaning that if a set of points all lie on the same line, then their images will also lie on a single line. We have observed that some collineations preserve shape and angle measure and that some collineations that preserve angle measure will also preserve distance. The transformations that preserve all of these, collinearity, angle measure, and distance, are called isometries .    Reflect and Wonder   Before reading this section, respond to the following questions. There are no right or wrong answers!   Write down three things you know about transformations, especially the three isometries we have looked at, namely reflections, translations, and rotations.    Is there anything that was discussed in the first sections on transformations that you need clarity on?    What do you wonder about transformations? What questions remain?         Isometry Between Congruent Figures  We are familiar with three types of isometries: reflections, translations, and rotations. Yet many questions remain: Are there other types of isometries? Are there transformations that are not isometries? If two figures are congruent, is there always an isometry mapping one to the other? If so, how do we determine what type of isometry it is?  Although we have not proved this fact, it is true that if we have two congruent figures, there will be an isometry that maps one onto the other. Our goal in this section and next will be to identify the type of isometry that takes one figure onto a congruent copy. Is it a reflection, a translation, a rotation, or something else? Then having determined the type can we specify the exact action that performs the movement. A good place to start is to identify whether the isometry maintains orientation.  Distinguishing Between Types of Isometries by Orientation     Imagine that is a moveable cutout triangle with a beach scene on the front face and gray cardboard on the back. We can think of the action of an isometry as moving so that it aligns perfectly with its image . Which isometries--reflections, translations, and rotations-- studied so far will keep beach side up? Which will turn over so that it is cardboard side up? What property is this related to?    How might you tell the difference between a translation and a rotation? Assume that you are given a picture of two congruent triangles and where the orientation is the same. How do you know whether a translation takes to ? How do you know whether the isometry is a rotation? Could it be both? or neither?        Recognizing Isometries by Fixed Points  Another way to distinguish between isometries is to note which points, if any, are unmoved by the isometry. Such a point is called a fixed point of the isometry. If is a fixed point of isometry , then . Following our convention of calling the image of point by the symbol , is a fixed point if . fixed point    Determining the Fixed Points of an Isometry   In , which point(s) are not moved by the reflection across ? Are there unlabeled points that are also fixed by this reflection? Explain.    In , which point(s) are not moved by the rotation about point ? Are there any unlabeled points that are also fixed by this reflection? Explain.    In , which point(s) are not moved by the translation by vector ? Are there any unlabeled points that are fixed by this translation? Explain.     Like the function you may have encountered in another course, there is a transformation of the plane that maps every point to itself. We call this transformation, the identity transformation . Under the action of the identity transformation, every point is a fixed point. Clearly, the identity function also preserves distance, angle measure, and orientation since it leaves everything unchanged. identity transformation      Defining Objects of Isometries  Once we determine whether the isometry mapping one figure onto a congruent image is a reflection, translation, or rotation, we need to specify which reflection, which translation, or which rotation it is. We do this by identifying the defining object(s) of the isometry. With a reflection, for example, we should specify which line we are reflecting across. lists the defining objects for the three isometries we have studied.   Defining Objects for Three Isometries         Isometry  Defining Objects    Reflection  Reflecting Line (or mirror)    Translation  Translation Vector    Rotation  Center and Rotational Angle     How do we find the mirror for a reflection? the vector for a translation? the center and angle for an rotation? Although the defining objects determine how the isometry acts on all points in the plane, we need just a few points along with their images in order to find the defining objects. As you work through make note of these methods and add them to your toolbox.   Finding Defining Objects of Isometries   For each isometry, we will observe some properties of the isometry and defining object(s) and then use these properties to locate the defining object(s).   Finding the Mirror of a Reflection     Refer to which shows a reflection of across line , how is the reflecting line related to each segment connecting a vertex of the triangle to its image?    Click on the tools available in the top menu of the following interactive. Then sketch the reflecting line for the isometry that takes to using the tools you think would enable you to determine the exact reflecting line. Do not use guess and check.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for finding the mirror of a reflection.      Use the Reflect About Line tool in the above app to check that reflecting across the line you created results in a triangle that aligns perfectly with .    Write down instructions of how you can create the reflecting line given a triangle and its reflected image . The instructions should be detailed enough that others can follow them.      Finding the Vector for a Translation  In , you were given a translation vector which indicated the direction and distance that each point should be moved, specifically three units right and one unit down. In the activity had the coordinates and had the coordinates . We will note that we could have chosen a different vector to represent three units right and one unit down.    If the point had the coordinates , what would the coordinates of be so that would represent a move of three units right and one unit down?    If the ending point has the coordinates , what would the coordinates of the starting point be so that would represent three units right and one unit down?    If point has the coordinates and the picture below shows a translation that moves the figure three units right and one unit down, what are the coordinates of ?    Draw, identify, or describe a vector for the translation that takes to in .   Triangle is translated to      Write instructions that you or someone else could use to find the translation vector when any figure and its image under a translation are given.      Finding the Center and Angle of a Rotation, part 1  In , an L-pentomino and its image under a rotation are shown.   Draw or identify the point that is the center of the rotation taking to . How do you know this point is the center?    Determine the angle of this rotation and specify whether the rotation is performed clockwise or counterclockwise.

If you click the vertices in the clockwise order, you will get .    An interactive Geogebra applet for finding the center and angle of a rotation in .

An interactive Geogebra applet for finding the center and angle of a rotation.       Perhaps the segments , , and might provide information. Sketch these three line segments. Do they help?    GeoGebra tools will allow you to find perpendicular lines, perpendicular bisectors, angle bisectors, circles, angle measures, and lengths. Any ideas of what we might try?

  "body": " Compositions of Reflections   Compositions  Each of the transformations we have studied so far, reflections, translations, and rotations, performs an action on the points of the plane. In fact, a transformation is a function where the inputs and outputs are geometric objects instead of numbers. In algebra, you learned about the add three function, written , and the multiply by four function, . You also learned that you could perform two functions in succession. For example, you could perform the add three function on the number and then perform the multiply by 4 function on the result. In function notation, we may write where we perform the inner function first. We may also perform these operations on a generic value : We note the importance of order. If we multiply by 4 first and add 3 second, we get a different result:   We now explore what happens when we compose geometric transformations. We could compose any two transformations, but we will first focus on reflections. What happens when we perform two or more reflections in succession? Do we get another reflection? Does it matter whether the lines are parallel? Does the order in which we perform the reflections matter?   composition    The composition of and .    A composition of two transformations is a sequence of two transformations, and , performed in succession. To find the image of a point under the composition, followed by , written , one first finds the image of under the action of and then finds the image of under .

Draw the line that passes through the midpoints of and . Then reflect across this line. What do you notice about the relationship between this new triangle and ?   Describe a two-transformation process that takes to .         The Four Isometries  In this chapter, we've explored the behavior of a particular type of transformation, called an isometry . This term comes from the Greek words iso- meaning equality and metria meaning measure .   isometry   An isometry is a function taking points on the plane to points on the plane which sends collinear points to collinear points and preserves the distance between points.    There are four types of isometries. Through our explorations, we have seen that the orientation of a figure is reversed each time it is reflected. Thus, orientation is changed under an odd number of reflections and maintained (flipped back) under an even number of reflections. Hence, the composition of two reflections in succession will be either a translation (when the reflecting lines are parallel) or a rotation (when the reflecting lines intersect). When we reflect across three lines, not all of which are parallel, we get an isometry which reverses the orientation of figures but is not a reflection. Instead we obtain what is known as a glide reflection.  A glide reflection is defined as a composition of a reflection across a line and a translation along a vector parallel to (or on) the reflecting line. In , note how the pentomino is first reflected across the line and then translated along vector . Any of the parallel vectors, like or , could be used as the translation vector, but the reflecting line here is , not . glide reflection    Glide reflection of a pentamino.   L-pentamino is reflected across line GH. Then its image is slid using vector GH. A and C are two vertices on the original.    Reflective Question  Will a glide reflection have any fixed point(s)?

  "body": " Mystery Isometries   Given two congruent figures, what is the isometry that maps one onto the other? In this section, we will learn how to identify the type of isometry for this mapping and to construct the axis of a reflection, the center and angle of a rotation, and a vector of a translation or glide reflection.    Review of Isometries  We know that an isometry is a transformation (or function) that preserves the measures of lines and angles. The original object and its image under an isometry are always congruent to each other. It turns out if we are given any two congruent figures in the plane there is an isometry that maps one of the figures onto the other. At the end of this section, you will be given a pair of congruent figures and then will determine the associated isometry using the properties you identified in the early part of the lab.

In each of the tasks, you will determine the type of isometry that maps the original figure to its image and then to sketch the defining objects (the reflecting line, translation vector, and\/or center). In the case of a rotation, also determine the angle of rotation and whether it is clockwise or counterclockwise.

  "body": " Symmetry   Snowflakes, product logos, rose windows, mandalas: these are just a few examples of symmetry in our world. While the applications to art and architecture may be most obvious, scientists observe symmetry as they study the structure and behavior of chemicals, plantlife, and reflected objects.    Two Types of Symmetry  Finite two-dimensional designs, such as snowflakes and logos, may have reflectional symmetry and\/or rotational symmetry. displays a design with both reflectional and rotational symmetry.   symmetry reflectional  reflectional symmetry  mirror symmetry  mirror line  line of symmetry  symmetry line of   A design is said to have reflectional symmetry if there is a line such that reflecting the design across that line causes the design to align perfectly with itself. This line is called a line of symmetry for the design. Each point on one side of the line of symmetry reflects to a corresponding image point on the other side of the line and the image of a point reflects back across the line to the original point.  Reflectional symmetry is also called mirror symmetry and a line of symmetry may be called a mirror . It is possible for a design with mirror symmetry to have multiple lines of symmetry.     Symmetric design created using    An abstract design with four lines of symmetry and 90-degree rotational symmetry. A square or times symbol has similar symmetry.    Check your Understanding  Draw the four lines of symmetry in . Verify that the design stays the same when reflected across each line.     A design is said to have rotational symmetry if there is a rotation about a point with a positive angle of less than 360 degrees that maps the design onto itself. The image of the design will look identical to the original even in location and angle. The number of positions that the figure can be rotated to and still look the same is called the order of symmetry . In calculating the order of symmetry, we count the original position (0-degree rotation) or a full 360-degree turn, but not both since they are the same position. If the order of symmetry of a figure is , we say that the figure has -fold symmetry.     Check your understanding     Where is the center of the rotation for the design in ?

Notice and Wonder  What did you notice about the lines of symmetry and centers of rotation as you were completing this activity? What do you wonder about symmetry of finite designs? What questions remain?      Symmetry Transformations   symmetry transformation  transformation symmetry   A symmetry transformation for a design is an isometry that sends the design perfectly onto itself. The appearance of the design remains the same after the action of a symmetry transformation.  We also may use just the word symmetry to refer to a symmetry transformation. The context of how the word appears will help us decide whether symmetry refers to the property of the design or the transformation that preserves the design.    In , we saw that when we performed a sequence of reflections in succession, the composition was the same as an isometry, either another reflection, a translation, a rotation, or a glide reflection depending on the number of reflections and whether the reflecting lines were parallel. With a finite design such as the one in , note that any lines of symmetry must intersect and their point of intersection will be in the center of the figure. If the figure also has rotational symmetry, the center of the rotation will also at this central point.  Reflective Questions  Explain why a translation and a glide reflection cannot be symmetry transformation of finite designs or polygons. Do you think translations and\/or glide reflections could be symmetry transformations of infinite tilings or infinite wallpaper borders? Explain in words and\/or pictures.   We now focus on the symmetries of a single equilateral triangle, investigating what happens when we compose symmetry transformations.   Symmetries of an Equilateral Triangle   Throughout this exploration, you may use the GeoGebra applet, as needed. You are also welcome to label and cut out an equilateral triangle for a tactile experience.   Rotations of an Equilateral Triangle  As previously discovered, an equilateral triangle has 3-fold symmetry.   What is the smallest positive degree angle of symmetry?    Suppose we name counterclockwise rotation by a 120-degree angle about the center of this triangle . What is the effect of performing twice in succession? Is it the same as a reflection or rotation? Specify how the reflecting line (if it is a reflection) or rotation angle (if it is a rotation) of the composed transformation    What happens if you rotate the triangle using three times in succession?    A 0-degree rotation can be represented by . Describe in your own words what happens when you apply . How does it compare to ?    A clockwise 120-degree rotation is the same as a counterclockwise rotation of what degree?      GeoGebra applet for exploring the symmetries of an equilateral triangle     Images of Symmetries  As we record the result of performing symmetries on the triangle in , we will use the notation , , to represent counterclockwise rotations of 0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees about the center of the triangle.  We will also use the notation , , and to denote the reflections across line with negative slope, line with positive slope, and the vertical line , respectively.  Because these are symmetries, the actions will always result in the same equilateral triangle. What changes is the locations of vertices , , and . Note that the image of the triangle after performing is the same as . We call this the Home Position. When using the GeoGebra applet , we can click on the icon in the upper right that looks like a circle with two clockwise-pointing arrows to return to the Home Position.   Home Position of Equilateral Triangle   An equilateral triangle. Vertex B on top and vertex A lower left and vertex C lower right.    Being sure to start in the home position each time, record where the vertices , , and land after each of the following symmetry transformations:                 Note that each of these five transformations should result in a different arrangement of the vertices, , , and , none of which will be the same as . You will need to refer to these arrangements in the next task.   Setting the Stage  To prepare for the final task, we will remind ourselves of what a multiplication table is. Complete .   Multiplication Table           1  2  3  4  5    1  1  2  3  4  5    2  2  4       3  3        4  4        5  5    20        Like the multiplication table above, we can create a table for the composition of symmetry isomorphisms on an equilateral triangle using the following steps as a guide. Each entry you add to the table should always be one of the six symmetries of the triangle; namely, , , , , , or . When you use to compute compositions, be sure to reset the triangle to home position before performing the first of the two actions and then perform the second action without resetting the triangle. Compare the final result to the vertex labels you recorded in .   The row and column headed by have already been filled in. Explain why this row and column is the same as the header row and column. In particular, what is the action of on the vertices of triangle ?    Determine the compositions of two rotations, namely , , , and . Add these results to the table in the appropriate locations.    The nine cells in the upper left should now be filled. With starting with the triangle in home position, perform followed by to compute In , we defined as in common practice in algebra . Compare the final result with the images you recorded in and write the corresponding symmetry in the cell of the -row and the -column.    Is the same as ? To determine this, start at the home position and then perform first followed by . Write the corresponding symmetry in the cell of the -row and the -column. Compare these two results.    To complete the -row, compute the two compositions:    , by first reflecting the triangle in home position across line and then rotating counterclockwise by 120 degrees, and     , by first reflecting the home position triangle across line and then rotating counterclockwise by 120 degrees.   The -row should now be completely filled. Each of the symmetries, , , , , , and will appear exactly once in this row.    Now complete the -row, each time performing the symmetry corresponding to the column heading before rotating counterclockwise 240 degrees. Be sure to return to the home position before beginning each calculation.    Similarly, we will complete the -row by performing the symmetry corresponding to the column heading first followed by a reflection across line . Check again to make sure that no symmetry appears twice in the same row.    Complete the last two rows where the second transformation is reflection across the lines and respectively.      Composition Table                                                                            Observations and Summary  Refer to your completed version of , as you answer the following:   Of the six symmetry transformations, , , , , , and , which transformation behaves like the number 1 does in multiplication? We call this transformation the identity transformation .    Which transformation undoes  ? In other words, which transformation can you perform after so that this two-step action gives the same result as the identity transformation? Does the order of these two transformations matter?  Algebra connection: How is this relationship like composing the multiply by five function and the divide by 5 function ?    Which transformation undoes  ?  Algebra connection: Is there a real number such that the multiplication by function, , undoes itself?    Algebra connection: The operation multiplication on the set of real numbers satisfies the commutative property, for all real numbers, and . Does composition of symmetry transformations satisfy the commutative property? Support your answer.         "

  "body": " Symmetries of an Equilateral Triangle   Throughout this exploration, you may use the GeoGebra applet, as needed. You are also welcome to label and cut out an equilateral triangle for a tactile experience.   Rotations of an Equilateral Triangle  As previously discovered, an equilateral triangle has 3-fold symmetry.   What is the smallest positive degree angle of symmetry?    Suppose we name counterclockwise rotation by a 120-degree angle about the center of this triangle . What is the effect of performing twice in succession? Is it the same as a reflection or rotation? Specify how the reflecting line (if it is a reflection) or rotation angle (if it is a rotation) of the composed transformation    What happens if you rotate the triangle using three times in succession?    A 0-degree rotation can be represented by . Describe in your own words what happens when you apply . How does it compare to ?    A clockwise 120-degree rotation is the same as a counterclockwise rotation of what degree?      GeoGebra applet for exploring the symmetries of an equilateral triangle     Images of Symmetries  As we record the result of performing symmetries on the triangle in , we will use the notation , , to represent counterclockwise rotations of 0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees about the center of the triangle.  We will also use the notation , , and to denote the reflections across line with negative slope, line with positive slope, and the vertical line , respectively.  Because these are symmetries, the actions will always result in the same equilateral triangle. What changes is the locations of vertices , , and . Note that the image of the triangle after performing is the same as . We call this the Home Position. When using the GeoGebra applet , we can click on the icon in the upper right that looks like a circle with two clockwise-pointing arrows to return to the Home Position.   Home Position of Equilateral Triangle   An equilateral triangle. Vertex B on top and vertex A lower left and vertex C lower right.    Being sure to start in the home position each time, record where the vertices , , and land after each of the following symmetry transformations:                 Note that each of these five transformations should result in a different arrangement of the vertices, , , and , none of which will be the same as . You will need to refer to these arrangements in the next task.   Setting the Stage  To prepare for the final task, we will remind ourselves of what a multiplication table is. Complete .   Multiplication Table           1  2  3  4  5    1  1  2  3  4  5    2  2  4       3  3        4  4        5  5    20        Like the multiplication table above, we can create a table for the composition of symmetry isomorphisms on an equilateral triangle using the following steps as a guide. Each entry you add to the table should always be one of the six symmetries of the triangle; namely, , , , , , or . When you use to compute compositions, be sure to reset the triangle to home position before performing the first of the two actions and then perform the second action without resetting the triangle. Compare the final result to the vertex labels you recorded in .   The row and column headed by have already been filled in. Explain why this row and column is the same as the header row and column. In particular, what is the action of on the vertices of triangle ?    Determine the compositions of two rotations, namely , , , and . Add these results to the table in the appropriate locations.    The nine cells in the upper left should now be filled. With starting with the triangle in home position, perform followed by to compute In , we defined as in common practice in algebra . Compare the final result with the images you recorded in and write the corresponding symmetry in the cell of the -row and the -column.    Is the same as ? To determine this, start at the home position and then perform first followed by . Write the corresponding symmetry in the cell of the -row and the -column. Compare these two results.    To complete the -row, compute the two compositions:    , by first reflecting the triangle in home position across line and then rotating counterclockwise by 120 degrees, and     , by first reflecting the home position triangle across line and then rotating counterclockwise by 120 degrees.   The -row should now be completely filled. Each of the symmetries, , , , , , and will appear exactly once in this row.    Now complete the -row, each time performing the symmetry corresponding to the column heading before rotating counterclockwise 240 degrees. Be sure to return to the home position before beginning each calculation.    Similarly, we will complete the -row by performing the symmetry corresponding to the column heading first followed by a reflection across line . Check again to make sure that no symmetry appears twice in the same row.    Complete the last two rows where the second transformation is reflection across the lines and respectively.      Composition Table                                                                            Observations and Summary  Refer to your completed version of , as you answer the following:   Of the six symmetry transformations, , , , , , and , which transformation behaves like the number 1 does in multiplication? We call this transformation the identity transformation .    Which transformation undoes  ? In other words, which transformation can you perform after so that this two-step action gives the same result as the identity transformation? Does the order of these two transformations matter?  Algebra connection: How is this relationship like composing the multiply by five function and the divide by 5 function ?    Which transformation undoes  ?  Algebra connection: Is there a real number such that the multiplication by function, , undoes itself?    Algebra connection: The operation multiplication on the set of real numbers satisfies the commutative property, for all real numbers, and . Does composition of symmetry transformations satisfy the commutative property? Support your answer.      "

Reflecting across a diagonal line is more challenging for some students. Encourage students to compare their sketches with others and discuss if there are different sketches. Miras (math education supply stores) or small mirrors (craft stores) can be effective at resolving differences and helping students visualize, but I recommend letting them draw the reflection first without these aids. Although much of this chapter will be done with GeoGebra apps, it is worthwhile to have students do this first activity on paper in small groups. Performing actions by hand gives deeper understanding, encourages teamwork, and introduces some properties of reflections in the coordinate plane across the -axis, -axis, and lines and . In preparation for this lesson, print out copies of the illustrations in this section, bring enough reddish, greenish, and blueish pencils so each group can have at least one of each color. Should students draw in the wrong color, they can indicate the color they used by making a mark in the text.  In , students should discover that the reflecting line is the perpendicular bisector of each segment joining a point in the original figure with its image. The task also reminds students that the diagonal of a 1x1-square has length . In , students should use what they learned to draw the reflecting line. If their line is off, encourage them to fold along their line to check their work and consider what they might do. This type of task will appear more later in the chapter. Keep it at an exploratory level at this point. Note that we have not learned how to draw a perpendicular bisector. An optional exploration MAYBE AN EXERCISE might be to discover how to use folding to create these. Current plans are to add a chapter on constructions, but probably later in the text. gives an introduction to composition of reflections, a topic which will be explored in depth in .

Students are used to performing computations from left to right. The author has debated whether to be consistent with composition notation or to use a new symbol that would facilitate a left-to-right method. This may change in future versions. Let me know what you think!  In , students should definitely be encouraged to hide as well as its vertices. The rotational angle is double the angle between the lines. Reversing the order in which points for the angle are selected may give measurements that make the doubling more obvious.    Notes for  This section gives an opportunity for students to apply their learning from this chapter in a fun challenge.    Notes for  The beginning of this section connects the notion of symmetry with the isomorphisms of this chapter. In the next chapter, we will connect dilations to similarity.  The subsection at the end of this section may be omitted or given as an extension for students who appreciate the challenge. Here, students will build a group table for compositions of symmetries of an equilateral table. Completion of this subsection provides a context for a discussion of algebraic properties like the commutative law, identity properties, and inverse properties.   "

Show all work.         Self-similar Triangles  The right triangle in had the property that the altitude drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse split the triangle into two smaller triangles, both of which were similar to the original triangle. This property is true for all right triangles since the measure of the two acute angles did not matter. In particular, each new triangle had a right angle and one of the original angles. Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, the newly created angle will have the same measure as the remaining angle of the original triangle.  Will this happen with other triangles?   A Special Triangle   In , an isosceles triangle with two 72-degree angles is provided. Use it to answer the following:    What is the measure of the third angle?    Compute , the ratio of the long side to the short side. Write the result with five significant digits. This means to include the five digits beginning with the leftmost nonzero digit. Be sure to write the decimal point as appropriate. .    Use the angle bisector tool to bisect angle . Let be the point where this bisector intersects side and create line segment . Use the show\/hide tool to hide bisector . Segment should still be visible.   Of the two smaller triangles created by bisecting , which (if any) are similar to ? Support your answer.    Suggestion: As we continue to focus on this new smaller triangle, you may find it useful to use the create polygon tool to highlight this triangle.  Write down the three pairs of corresponding sides.    What is the constant of proportionality, for this similarity? As you record this number, write down at least four digits after the decimal point. Adjust your calculator settings to show more digits if needed.    Note that the constant of proportionality depends on whether you chose to divide the shorter length by the longer or to divide the longer length by the shorter. Perform whichever computation have not already done and record at least four digits after the decimal point.    What do you notice about these two numbers?       A Golden Triangle     Now use the angle bisector tool to bisect angle in . Let be the point where this angle bisector intersects segment . Draw segment and hide ray .   Name another triangle in the sketch which is similar to .    Name two triangles in the sketch that are similar to .      Reflective Questions and Extensions  Based on your work in this exploration, discuss the following:   If you use the arrow tool to move vertex or , the lengths of the sides of triangles will change, but the angle measures will not. Do the constants of proportionality change?    Suppose you continued this process, bisecting to create triangle , then bisecting to create , and so forth. What type of design would you get? What properties would it have?    The area tool is under the angle menu. What is the ratio of the areas of similar triangles and ? How is this number related to the ratio of the corresponding sides?   Use the create-polygon tool to create before using the GeoGebra area tool.         "

Hence, it is essential that we can simplify expressions and solve equations.   expression  algebraic expression  numerical expression   An expression in mathematics is a representation of a numerical quantity consisting of a finite number of variables and\/or numbers joined by algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

We will also use the term numerical expression to describe any representation that is either an algebraic expression or number.    Note the difference between an expression and an equation.   algebraic equation  equation   An equation is a statement formed by joining two algebraic expressions together with an equal sign.

In this situation, a series of equal signs in succession are allowed. You show verify that any expressions joined by this symbol are indeed equal.   Simplifying an Expression   Simplify the expression .    Solving this expression requires an expansion of before we can subtract . One correct way of writing this is the following.

When solving an equation, it is bad practice to put equal signs between steps as the quantity frequently changes.

Solving an Equation   Solve the equation     One acceptable way of writing this for exercises is the following: We have found two numbers and that solve the equation.

  "title": "Functions and Operations",
  "body": " Functions and Operations   Operations, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, give us a way of combining numbers and expressions. It is worth the time to read the symbols that tell us what operation is being used.  Functions typically involve operations, but they play a different role. A function is a rule that allows us to assign an output for each allowable input. In algebra, functions are often given by an algebraic expression where we can replace the variable by the input and compute the value of the corresponding output. We also use letters, like or , to name our function. The symbol stands for the output when function is performed on and the symbol stands for the output when function is performed on . When graphing functions, we think of each output of the function as being and graph the pairs .   A Function from Algebra   Let . Compute the following:               a) , b) , c) which can be simplified to .    Functions do not have to have algebraic formulas; for example, we could define a function that assigns the number 0 to all even numbers and 1 to all odd numbers. In this example, , , and . In geometry, we will be looking at transformations, which are functions that map points to points. Sometimes, we can write geometric functions algebraically like but that goes beyond the scope of this course.  Having seen some examples, we now give the definition of function.   function   A function is a mapping that assigns to each input exactly one output.    As noted above the inputs and outputs be numbers or other objects such as points or even lines. What distinguishes a function from other mappings is that each input has exactly one output . Although it is possible for several inputs to have the same output, say , it is not possible for and . Under the action of a function, each input uniquely determines its output.    Working with squares and square roots  Two functions of interest to us in geometry are the squaring function and the square root function .   square root  square   The square of a number is the number . Note that the number may be negative, positive, or 0, but the square, is always greater than or equal to 0.  The square root of a number is the nonnegative number such that . We use the notation to represent the square root of .     Computing Squares and Square Roots   Compute the following using the definitions of square and square root. A calculator should not be necessary.                  a) , b) , c) , d)     In , we observe how the actions of squaring and taking the square root undo each other. The square of is and the square root of is . Similarly, the square root of is and the square of is . Thus, when we perform a square and a square root in succession, the two actions cancel each other out. For this reason, the squaring function and the square root function are said to be inverse operations on the set of nonnegative numbers A number is said to be nonnegative if . . Since geometric measurements are nonnegative, we may use the square root function to undo the squaring function and vice versa. Thus, whenever you would like to undo the squaring function in an equation such as in the above example, we will take the square root of both sides.   Inverse Property of Squares and Square Roots   Let be a nonnegative real number. Then and .    Using the Pythagorean Theorem to find lengths will require squaring and taking square roots of numbers. The equation in the Pythagorean Theorem can be written equivalently as or . Note the use of the inverse action: . In fact, the squaring function also undoes the square root function: . This is what we mean by a pair of inverse functions; applying them one right after the other (in either order) cancels their action. On the other hand, we need to be careful in applying an inverse operation. The square root of is not equal to because the square of is not . Instead, the square of is so that .   Finding the Length of a Leg of a Right Triangle   The length of the hypotenuse is 16 inches and the length of one leg is 10 inches. Determine the length of the other leg.    By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know or . Subtracting from both sides of the equation, we get . Taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we see     Our examples demonstrate that , but what if the operation is multiplication or division? In this situation, the expression can be simplified.   Exponents and Roots of Products and Quotients   Let and be nonnegative real numbers. Then and If , then and .  Moreover, if is any nonnegative integer, we can say that and . Also and when .      Other Pairs of Inverse Functions  The square and square root functions are not the only pair of functions that undo each other. Some pairs that you may be more familiar with include adding and subtracting and the two function, dividing by and multiplying by . Note how the two functions in each pair undo each other and recall how you have used them to solve equations.  Extending the equality principles, and , we often use the method of performing the same operation to both sides of an equation. Typically, the chosen operation is the inverse of an operation that appears in the equation.  When working in three dimensional geometry, we will need to compute the cube of a number which we can write as or . The cubing function and cube root function are also inverses of each other.   Using Inverses to Solve an Equation   Solve the equation .    Adding to both sides of gives us . Next we divide the expressions on both sides by , resulting in . Finally, we take the cube root of both sides, leaving us with . Checking our answer, we verify that as desired.      Order of Operations  In , you may have wondered whether it was better to add four first or divide by five. Would it even make a difference?  Because of the way that operations are built on each other Multiplication is repeated addition, and exponentiation is repeated multiplication. , the order of performing algebraic operations is prescribed. When performing computations, we perform exponentiation before multiplication and division and we perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. We also perform computations from left to right. Parentheses or other grouping symbols, such as a fraction bar We can also use placement and size of type, like or . , are used when we want to treat a numerical expression as a single quantity. Thus, we start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out.  When there are variables in an expression, we may not be able to perform operations in the standard order. Without a specified value, we cannot add a number like to an expression like . Instead, we use the distributive law and concept of like terms to simplify our expression.  As equations become more complex, there is no specific order in which to perform inverse operations. If one or both sides can be simplified, that is often a good first or intermediate step. Undoing operations is typically done in the reverse order, just as we need to unpeel layers of clothing in the evening, each item being removed in the opposite order in which it was put on. Our goal in a linear equation is to get down to a single appearance of the variable and to isolate that variable, as in . In polynomial equations, we usually aim to manipulate the expression until all variables and nonzero numbers are on one side of the equation so that we can factor the expression and apply to find all solutions.   Solving Equations with Order of Operations   Solve the equation, .    We will demonstrate several methods. To emphasize how order of operations are reversed when undoing operations, we note that adding 8 would be last in a computation. Thus our first step is to subtract 8 (or add ) to both sides of our equation, resulting in . Next we, divide both sides by , leaving . Finally, we add to get .  Note that if we start by dividing by 5, tells us that we must also divide 8 by 5. The resulting equation, or , is correct but more difficult to solve.  Finally, we could solve this equation by first simplifying the left side. Our expression Replacing the original left side by this simplified version gives . Adding to both sides gives and dividing by 5 gives .     "
