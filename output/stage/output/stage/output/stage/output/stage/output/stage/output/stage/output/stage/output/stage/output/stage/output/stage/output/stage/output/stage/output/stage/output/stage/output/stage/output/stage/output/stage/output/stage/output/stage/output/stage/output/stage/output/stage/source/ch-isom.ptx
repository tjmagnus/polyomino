    <title>Transformations</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Are you aware that animated movies and computer graphics use a lot of mathematics
        and geometry? The images are moved by moving key points to new locations on the screen and 
        the screen. The process of moving each point in the Euclidean plane to a new, possibly the same, point
        is called a <term>transformation</term>. 
        <idx><h>transformation</h></idx>
        Every point is assigned a 
        single landing position; no point 
        is sent to more than one position by a single transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it is impossible to show the action of a transformation on every 
        point in the plane, we typically will view how a transformation affects a 
        given figure. The images below show two examples of the effect of transformations on 
        the pentomino <m>ABCDEFGH</m>.

              point outside the pentomino is shown in blue.

              is a larger copy of the original shown in blue. It has been reflected across a 
              line and enlarged by a factor of 1.5.

        The first image shows a transformation which moves objects by a rotation but 
        does not change any lengths or angle measures. Transformations like this one 
        that preserve distance and shape are called <term>isometries</term> or 
        <term>rigid transformations</term>. 
        Even though shape is preserved, the transformation in the second image 
        is not an isometry because 
        it does not preserve distance; the lengths of the sides change.
