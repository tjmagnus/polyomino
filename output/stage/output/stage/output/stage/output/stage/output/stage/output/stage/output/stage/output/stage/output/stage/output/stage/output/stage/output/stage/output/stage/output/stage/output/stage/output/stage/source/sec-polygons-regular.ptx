  <introduction>

    <p>
        Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this  
        section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings 
        can be used to tile the plane.

  <title>Regular Tilings</title>
  <p>
    In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominoes. 
    In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues  
    infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to 
    build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.

        A <term>tiling</term> is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane 
        (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no 
        gaps and no overlaps. A <term>monohedral tiling</term> is tiling that 
        uses only one shape, 
        a <term>regular tiling</term> is a monohedral tiling using a single 
        regular polygon as its tile. In a regular tiling, each side of a polygon 
        will line up perfectly with a side of an adjacent copy.

        This activity may be completed using physical tiles or 
        in an app. Be sure to save a record of your designs by 
        tracing, photography, or screenshots. Some of the computations  
        will also be used later in this section. You are encourage to 
        keep an accessible record of your work for future reference.

        The web application <url href="https://mathigon.org/polypad#polygons">Polypad
        by Mathigon</url> provides regular <m>n</m>-gons for <m>3\leq n\leq 8</m>. 
        These are the top six shapes in the Polygons and Shapes menu. Simply 
        drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area. Rotate using the black dot 
        and move by clicking on the interior. For <m>n</m>-gons with <m>n>8</m>, use  
        the hexagon labeled "regular" in the bottom rom of shapes. After you have moved this  
        figure into the whiteboard, use the dotted vertex to increase the number of sides.
        You can then use the duplicated sheet icon on the flip/cut/... menu to make copies 
        of your <m>n</m>-gon.

          tiling can continue to tile the plane with no gaps and overlaps.

          Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, 
          regular hexagons, and other regular <m>n</m>-gons to determine which can 
          be used to create a regular tiling and which do not. What do you think 
          will happen with regular polygons with more than eight sides? Why?

          Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure places a role in determining 
          whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. This task will  
          lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We 
          will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other   
          regular n-gons.

  This activity may have involved more of a struggle that some of the others. Perhaps you

  or you cannot yet see a pattern to help determine which vertex arrangements lead to a 
  semiregular tiling. That is perfectly normal. Write down the ideas that you do have and

  <title>Narrowing Down the Options</title>
    <p>
      When we look at possible vertex arrangements for a semiregular tiling,
      our options are very limited. Not including the regular tiling by squares, 
      you should have found three groups of four regular polygons with an 
      angle sum of 360 degrees. All of these have at least one polygon appearing 
      twice. Why do some of these extend to a semiregular tiling while others do 
      not? Does it matter whether the common polygons are next to each other 
      or separated?    
    </p>
    <p>
      As we attempt to create a 3.3.6.6 pattern, we find that it is impossible to 
      maintain a consistent vertex arrangement. Fairly quickly, we are forced to 
      create a 3.6.3.6 arrangement at some vertices. On the other hand, a 3.3.6.6 
      vertex arrangement can continue indefinitely. Let us explore why this happens.  
    </p>

          Use physical or virtual triangles and hexagons to 
          sketch the vertex arrangement 3.3.6.6 or refer to an earlier  
          sketch if available. <!--Add app?-->
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Choose one of the two triangles at this vertex and attempt 
              to surround it with triangles and/or hexagons while adhering 
              to the 3.3.6.6 arrangement.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Note that each triangle in a 3.3.6.6 must share a side with 
              one triangle and one hexagon due to the order of the 3's and 6's.

      We conclude that there are only two semiregular tilings and one regular 
      tiling of the plane where four polygons meet at a vertex. All three vertex 
      arrangements with five polygons meeting extend to semiregular tilings. 
      To complete this analysis, we consider which three-polygon vertex arrangements  
      extend to a semiregular tiling.

    What should we add to our tool box for later use? Definitions for regular polygons,
    tilings, regular tilings, and semiregular tilings were introduced at the beginning

          any triangle add up to 180 degrees. What is the total for a convex quadrilateral,

          Just because a collection of regular polygons can surround a vertex  
          does not mean that they can create a semiregular tiling. Give an example 
          of a vertex arrangement that does not extend to a regular tiling. Support
