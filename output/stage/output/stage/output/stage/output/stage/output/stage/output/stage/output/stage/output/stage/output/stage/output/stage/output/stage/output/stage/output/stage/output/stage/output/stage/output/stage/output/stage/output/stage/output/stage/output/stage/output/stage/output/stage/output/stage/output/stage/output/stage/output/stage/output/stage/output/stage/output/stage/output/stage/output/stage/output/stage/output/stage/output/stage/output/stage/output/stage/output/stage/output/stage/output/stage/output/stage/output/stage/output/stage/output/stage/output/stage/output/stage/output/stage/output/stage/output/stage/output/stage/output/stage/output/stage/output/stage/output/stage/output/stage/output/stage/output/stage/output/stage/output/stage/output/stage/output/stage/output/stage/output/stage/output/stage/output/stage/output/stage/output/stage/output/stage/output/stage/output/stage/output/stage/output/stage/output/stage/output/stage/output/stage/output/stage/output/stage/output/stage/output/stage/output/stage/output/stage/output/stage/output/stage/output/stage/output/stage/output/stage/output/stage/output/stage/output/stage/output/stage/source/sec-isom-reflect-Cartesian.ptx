  <title>An Introduction to Reflections</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    A <term>reflection</term> is the first transformation we will explore. 
    Each reflection is defined by a 
    mirror line and the reflection takes each point to its reflected image. If we were to fold the plane across
    the mirror line, the points and their images would fall on top of each other.
    The exploration <xref ref="expl-reflect-pentomino-coordplane"/> is best 
    done by hand so that you get a deeper understanding 
    of what happens to points in a transformation. Print out the pictures and use colored 
    pencils. The ability to fold your paper may prove helpful!
</p>
<p component="instructor">
    A pdf version of this activity is available MAKE SURE TYPO on p.2 part b is corrected (y-axis not x-axis). Be sure to check that students correctly 
    sketch the reflection in <xref ref="drawreflection"/>. Encourage students to compare 
    their sketches with others and discuss if there are different sketches. Miras (math education supply stores) or  small 
    mirrors (craft stores) can be effective at resolving differences and helping students visualize,
    but I recommend letting them try to draw the reflection first without these aids.

        Key Ideas regarding Reflections
    </title>
    <p>
        In this section, we have draw reflections by hand using a coordinate grid 
        as an aid and we observed a few of the properties of reflections. Since we will be  
        building on these discoveries, it is wise to summarize the main ideas for future 
        reference.

        <statement>
            <p>
                A <term>reflection across a line <m>\ell</m></term> is a transformation of the points in the 
                plane which maps each point <m>P</m> in the plane by flipping it over
                line <m>\ell</m>. The reflecting line <m>\ell</m> is called the <term>mirror</term>
                or <term>axis</term>. The <term>image</term> of a point <m>P</m> under a 
                reflection (or any other transformation) is the point <m>P'</m> that the 
                transformation sends <m>P</m> to; in this case, the reflection of point <m>P</m>.  
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
        While the notion of reflecting can be intuitively understood as flipping, the 
        properties you discovered in <xref ref="disc-prop-reflection-perp-bis"></xref> 
        provide a more specific definition that can be extended to other geometries. These  
        properties are identified in the next exercise. 
    </p>
    <exercise label="fillin-refl-def-prop">
        <title>Defining Property of a Reflection</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The reflecting line <m>\ell</m> meets the segment <m>\overline{PP'}</m>,
                connecting a point <m>P</m> and its reflected image <m>P'</m>, at a
                ________-degree angle.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
        So far, we have only reflected across lines that were either horizontal, 
        vertical, or which make a 45-degree angle to the horizontal. As we expand our 
        consideration to other reflections, we will drop the coordinate grid and use  
        technology.
