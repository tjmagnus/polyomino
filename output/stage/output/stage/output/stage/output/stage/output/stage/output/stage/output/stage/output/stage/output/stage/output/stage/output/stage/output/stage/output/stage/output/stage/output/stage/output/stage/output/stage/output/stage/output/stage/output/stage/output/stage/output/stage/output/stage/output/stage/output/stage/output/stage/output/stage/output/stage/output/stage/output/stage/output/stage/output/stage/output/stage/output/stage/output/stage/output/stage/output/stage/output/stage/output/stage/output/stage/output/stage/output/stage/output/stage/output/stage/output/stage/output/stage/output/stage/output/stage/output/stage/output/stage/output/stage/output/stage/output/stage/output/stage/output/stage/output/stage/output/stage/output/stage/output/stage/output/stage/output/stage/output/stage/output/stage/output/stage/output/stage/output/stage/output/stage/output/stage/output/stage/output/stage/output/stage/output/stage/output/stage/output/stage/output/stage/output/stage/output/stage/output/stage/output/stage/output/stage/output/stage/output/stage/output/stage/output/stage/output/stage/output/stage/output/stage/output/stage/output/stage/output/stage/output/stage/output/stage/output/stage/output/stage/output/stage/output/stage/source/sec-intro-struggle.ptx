      <title>Growing through Persistance</title>
 
      <p>
        Have you ever watched a baby learn a new skill, like walking, crawling, or even 
        rolling over? The child does not master the skill on the first try, but they are 
        determined. They fall down, but they keep trying. They readjust what they are doing, 
        figure out how to create momentum and balance, and finally succeed. Even then they 
        may stumble, but they persist. In the process, they grow stronger and can apply these  
        skills to later learning, like running, climbing the cabinets, reaching the cookie jar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout our lives, we grow by challenging ourselves to move beyond our comfort zone. 
        We learn to read and write, to play games and sports, to cook, make music, or other art. 
        Our brains are muscles that develop as we attempt new challenges. That the 
        nature of mathematics involves struggling with a problem, trying different 
        strategies, taking breaks but persisting. In the explorations in this section, 
        you will find that some of the problems are easy, but others require looking at 
        the problem in new ways and trying different strategies.

      <title>Triangles on a Geoboard</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          You may use tools that you remember from previous courses, such as 
          the area formula for a triangle and the Pythagorean Theorem, as you 
          complete this activity. We will explore why these formulas hold in 
          <xref ref="ch-polygons"/>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            In this exploration, we will work with a geoboard that has four rows 
            and four columns of pins such as the one pictured below.
          </p>
          <image source="4by4geoboard" width="50%">
            <description>
              A grid with 16 dots arranged in four rows and four columns.

          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Measuring along any row, we will assume that the horizontal 
                distance between neighboring dots on a geoboard is one unit. 
                What is the distance across the top of the geoboard from the leftmost 
                pin to the rightmost pin?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Similarly, the vertical distance between neighboring pins in any 
                column will be one unit. Determine the area of the square whose vertices 
                are the four outermost pins on this geoboard.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Determine the shortest diagonal distance between two pins. In other
                words, what is the distance from the pin in the upper left corner to 
                the pin in the second row and second column?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What is the distance from the top left pin to the bottom right pin?
              </p>
            </li>

          <p>
            As we construct triangles and other shapes on our geoboard, note that 
            each vertex must be one one of the sixteen pins.

      <title>Confronting the Challenge</title>
      <p>
        To give you the experience of confronting the challenge and the exhilaration 
        of conquering it, the answer to the last task in this exploration will not 
        be provided here. Searching for solutions or examples will not help you grow mathematically. 
        Instead, consider other ways in which you might attack the problem. Dare to 
        try something new!
      </p>
      <p>
        The above exploration starts off relatively easy. 
        Once students understand 
        how to create and measure shapes on the geoboard, most 
        can quickly find triangles with areas of <m>\frac{1}{2}, 1, 
        \frac{3}{2}, 2, 3</m>, and <m>\frac{9}{2},</m>. In fact, they find  
        multiple triangles with these areas. Yet the remaining areas may
        seem impossible. At some point they begin to 
        realize why they keep finding triangles with these five areas and begin 
        to think differently about how they might create triangles on the geoboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these new triangles, a new question emerges: How does one compute the 
        area? To use the area formula, <m>A=\frac{1}{2}bh</m>, one needs to know the 
        values of <m>b</m> and <m>h</m>. How does one find <m>b</m> and <m>h</m> with 
        certainty? Are there other ways of finding the area?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many lessons to be learned here that go beyond measuring area. 
        Mathematics is not about doing fast calculations with provided formulas or 
        following steps. Instead, it requires persistance, creative thinking, and 
        multiple strategies. Sometimes it is helpful to walk away from a problem for a 
        little while and to look at it differently when you return to it. It helps to 
        share ideas with others even when you do not know where they will lead. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Did you discover a triangle that was not obvious? Did you 
        think figure out a way to compute the area of these triangles? Did you help 
        others understand? Be proud of  
        your discoveries and contributions. You are a mathematician! 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, each student brings their own individual strengths to 
        the class. Some are great at remembering and applying formulas, some are 
        great at drawing sketches, some recognize patterns, some build on others' 
        ideas, some explain results and connections. In fact, you may find yourself  
        contributing in different ways on different activities. The important thing 
        is to believe in yourself and be open to trying new things. Unfortunately, 
        most people believe the lie that they can't do math and spend too much energy
        comparing themselves to others. Math is not about being perfect or fast.
        Instead it is about exploring, creating, experimenting, conjecturing, applying,
        and justifying.

        If today was not your day to shine, perhaps you were hesitant to consider 
        alternative approaches or to pursue your ideas. This particular topic might 
        not have engaged you in the same way as it did others. Or maybe it was just 
        an off day. There will be more opportunities  
        to overcome challenges throughout this book, and so long as you are open to 
        learning and exploring your own ideas, you will grow in mathematical ability 
        and confidence. After all, the course has just 
        started and you are just getting to know the book and its style, your 
        instructor and your classmates. By the way, your brain may hurt a little as 
        you confront and conquer mathematical challenges. Like every other muscle in 
        your body, a little soreness means that you are growing in strength. Success  
        comes from overcoming the struggle, from remembering and building on the accomplishments.
