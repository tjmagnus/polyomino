    <p>add an activity here, perhaps Mobius band, spherical triangles, or Euler's formula.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p> What is the derivative of <m>f(x)=\frac{x^2+1}{x}</m>? </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Rewrite the fraction before taking the derivative.
