    <title>Introduction to Geometrical Thinking</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Geometry is all around us, in nature, in architecture, in art,
        in games, and in technology. Throughout history, humans have 
        marveled upon geometrical patterns, investigated possibilities, 
        developed geometrical tools, and shared these discoveries with 
        others. Mathematicians use logic to confirm what they appear to 
        see and to convince other scholars. The theorems and formulas that you 
        have likely encountered in previous classes were developed and refined 
        over the last two millenia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these formulas and theorems are worth knowing well: basic area and volume 
        formulas, the Pythagorean theorem, for example, arise frequently in applications and 
        conversation. You can apply geometry to real-world problems and you 
        will appear more literate if you can know them well. However, 
        memorization and application is not the primary goal of this course. 
        After all, search engines, calculators, and artificial intelligence can 
        recall formulas and perform calculations for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of greater worth, is the ability to see the mathematics around 
        us, to ask questions and seek understanding, to imagine and create, 
        and to share our knowledge with others. In this first chapter and 
        throughout the book, you will be encouraged to practice mathematical 
        habits of mind that will enable you to learn new ideas and delve deeper 
        into familiar topics. At the same time, we will be establishing some
        key geometrical ideas that will be revisited later in the course.
