    <title>Summary of Key Ideas, Principles, and Theorems </title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        This section provides a list of all the principles that we have accepted 
        and all theorems that we have proved in <xref ref="ch-intro"/>. You may 
        use any of these as you work through subsequent chapters of the text. 
        Algebraic principles are also listed here; they allow us to use all of the 
        expression-simplifying and equation-solving techniques studied in algebra 
        classes.
