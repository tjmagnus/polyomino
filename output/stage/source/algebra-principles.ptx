          An <term>expression</term> in mathematics is a representation of a 
          numerical quantity consisting of a finite number of variables and/or 
          numbers joined by algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
          multiplication, division, and exponentiation. An expression 
          is said to be <term>algebraic</term> if it contains at least one variable.

            We summarize the principles that define operations on the 
            set of real numbers. Methods of performing calculations, 
            simplifying algebraic expressions, and solving equations follow 
            from these principles.

        <title>Working with squares and square roots</title>
        The notation <m>c^2</m> is read <m>c</m>-squared and is equivalent to 
        the product <m>c\times c</m>. Later in this text we will be interested 
        in cubing a number <m>s</m> which we can write as <m>s^3</m> or 
        <m>s\times s\times s</m>. On the set of nonnegative 
        numbers <fn>A number <m>x</m> is said to be <term>nonnegative</term> if 
        <m>x\ge 0</m>. The square root cannot undo the action of squaring a 
        negative number like <m>-3</m> because <m>\sqrt{(-3)^2}=3</m>.</fn>, the 
        square root acts as the inverse (or "undoing") function of the squaring 
        function. Thus, whenever you would like to undo the squaring function 
        in an equation such as in the above example, we will take the square 
        root of both sides. Hence, the equation in the Pythagorean Theorem can 
        be written equivalently as <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}=\sqrt{c^2}</m> or 
        <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}=c</m>. Note the inverse action: <m>\sqrt{c^2}=c</m>. 
        In fact, the squaring function also undoes the square root function: 
        <m>(\sqrt{c})^2=\sqrt{c}\times\sqrt{c}=c</m>. This is what we mean by a 
        pair of inverse functions; applying them one right after the other 
        (in either order) cancels their action. Examples of inverse function 
        pairs that you may be more familiar with include adding 4 and subtracting 
        4 and also dividing by 10 and multiplying by 10. Note how the two 
        functions undo each other and recall how you have used them to solve 
        equations. 
        The cubing function and cube root function are also inverses.
