<div class="para">Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a <dfn class="terminology">tetromino</dfn> is a flat figure created by joining four congruent squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape, and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain why you believe the tiling is impossible.</div>
