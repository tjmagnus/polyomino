<div class="para">Although a circle is not a polygon, we include the formula for its area here. In fact, Archimedes (287-212 BC) determined the area of a circle by looking at inscribed and circumscribed polygons. As the number of sides grew, the area of the polygons would approach the area of the circle, with the area of the inscribed polygons giving a lower estimate and the area of the circumscribed polygons giving an overestimate. The number <span class="process-math">\(pi\)</span> was not known at the time, but this method provides a means of calculating <span class="process-math">\(pi\)</span> to any level of precision.</div>
