</h5>
<div class="para">Write an essay (2 to 4 pages) in which you discuss the experiences in your life that have formed you as a mathematician or geometer. This essay will be unique to you, but here are some questions that you might consider in your reflection: Were there any turning points in your education? What experiences have stimulated and which have stimied your mathematical growth? Are there obstacles that you have overcome or would like to overcome? How? What are you personal goals in this course? What do you see as personal challenges to being successful?</div>
<div class="para">The paper should <em class="emphasis">not</em> be a mere timeline (boring!) or a list of answers to the questions above (disjointed), but instead <em class="emphasis">should</em> be a cohesive essay that focuses on the development of your mathematical ability, confidence, and attitude, centering on a few key turning points.  Examples of experiences that help illustrate your statements should be included. How did the class format (lecture, testing, activities, interaction, pacing) change you? Did you have experiences beyond the classroom that affected your mathematical growth? </div>
<div class="para">You may be asked to look back on this essay at the end of the semester to assess personal growth. Your instructor may also use this autobiography to better understand you as a student. In case your instructor knows your past teachers, use psuedonyms or letters to refer to them. The essay should focus on you, not your teachers.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-intro-explore.html#Writing-intro-exp-autobiography" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
