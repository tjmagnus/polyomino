<div class="para">Unfortunately, most students have had little opportunity to creatively explore in their mathematics classes. You have probably memorized formulas and performed calculations in many of your mathematics classes. While formulas and calculations are useful tools in mathematics, they are not the essence of mathematics and can often be done via a computer. In this course, we will develop the creative thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving practices that set humans apart computers and are valued by employers. We will think outside the box, make predictions, and wonder why. Different approaches and strategies are encouraged. Relax and have fun exploring mathematics!</div>
