</h4> <div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</dfn> is a three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons. Both of the solids in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "fig-convex-concave-polyhedra" missing or not unique]</code> are polyhedra, but the one on the left is said to be <dfn class="terminology">concave</dfn> since we can connect some vertices, like the far left and top vertex with straight segments that pass through the exterior (outside the surface) of the solid. As we work through this chapter, we will assume that a polyhedron is convex so that it has no valleys or depressions. Any line segment connecting two points on the surface of a convex polyhedron will only contain points on the surface or interior of the polyhedron.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/concaveconvexaligned.png" class="contained" alt="A concave polyhedron and a convex polyhedron"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.1.2<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>A concave polyhedron and a convex polyhedron</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">face</dfn> of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two faces meet are called <dfn class="terminology">edges</dfn>, and the points where edges meet are called the <dfn class="terminology">vertices</dfn> of the polyhedron. The vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of its polygonal faces.</div> <div class="para">While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a ‘side’, one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms <dfn class="terminology">face</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">edge</dfn> will make our discussions about polyhedra clearer.</div> <div class="para">Note also that a polyhedron has more than one type of angle. In this section, we will be working with angles whose rays are adjacent edges of the polyhedron. Each of these angles is a vertex angle of one of the faces of the polyhedron; hence, we may refer to them as <dfn class="terminology">face angles</dfn>.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="def-polyhedron-12-5-2"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 3.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="def-polyhedron-12-5-2">This is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same as a <dfn class="terminology">dihedral angle</dfn>, measuring the space between two faces</div></details> </div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-polyhedra-regular.html#def-polyhedron">in-context</a></span>
