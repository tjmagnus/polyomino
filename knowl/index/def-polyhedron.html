</h4> <div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</dfn> is a three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons. Unless stated otherwise, we will assume that a polyhedron is convex so that it has no valleys or depressions. Any line segment connecting two points on the surface of a convex polyhedron will only contain points on the surface or interior of the polyhedron.</div>  <div class="para">Here, a <dfn class="terminology">face</dfn> of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two faces meet are called <dfn class="terminology">edges</dfn>, and the points where edges meet are called the <dfn class="terminology">vertices</dfn> of the polyhedron. The vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of its polygonal faces.</div> <div class="para">While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a ‘side’, one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms <dfn class="terminology">face</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">edge</dfn> will make our discussions about polyhedra clearer.</div> <div class="para">Similarly,</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-polyhedra-regular.html#def-polyhedron">in-context</a></span>
