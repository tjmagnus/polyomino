<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">You’ve probably heard the expression, “The shortest distance between two points lies along a line.” We shall use this property of line segment to determine which linear features on a sphere are actually lines and line segments. Suppose you’re planning to fly from Chicago, Illinois (41.8781N, 87.6298W), to Rome, Italy (41.9028N,12.4964E). There are many paths you could take, many of which might qualify as lines under your suggestions above.  Which of these gives the shortest distance from Chicago to Rome?  If a globe is available, find Chicago and Rome and experiment with a string to find the path of least distance. If you do not have a globe, mark the approximate locations of Chicago and Rome on your sphere; each should be midway between the equator and the north pole, with Rome approximately a quarter of the way around east of Chicago. Tighten the string connecting these two cities to observe the path of shortest distance between them.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Describe this line segment.  Does it follow a latitude line? Bend toward the north pole?  Bend toward the equator?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Allow the “line” to extend “forever” beyond the two points. What figure does it form?  How is this figure related to the sphere itself?</div></li>
