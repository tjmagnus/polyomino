<div class="para">The two explorations, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/parallel-explor-lines-sphere.html" title="Exploration 2.3.1: Defining Lines on a Sphere">Exploration 2.3.1</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/parallel-explor-spherical-triangles.html" title="Exploration 2.3.2: Properties of Spherical Lines and Triangles">Exploration 2.3.2</a> led to some observations that might have surprised you. One of the ways in which spherical geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that no lines on the sphere are parallel. Of course, we could have defined <dfn class="terminology">line</dfn> differently, but that would have led to a loss of other properties of lines, such as the existence and uniqueness of a line joining any pair of points. Hence, we need to be clear regarding the geometry we are working with. Except where specified, our study will be limited to Euclidean geometry and Playfair’s Parallel Postulate will be one of our principles.</div>
