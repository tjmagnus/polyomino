<div class="para">A friend (or one of your students) asks you why the area formula for a triangle is <span class="process-math">\(A(tri)=\frac{1}{2}bh\text{.}\)</span> Rewrite and elaborate on your answer to the previous task to give a clear, thorough, and cohesive explanation. Be sure to use words and pictures as needed to make the definitions of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> clear. The relationship between the triangle and the parallelogram needs to be made explicit as well. Do they have the same height and base? Why or why not? Why must their areas be related and how?</div>
