<div class="para">So I encourage you to embrace the experience that is mathematics. Approach each puzzle with an open mind, make guesses as to what is happening, and experiment to determine whether your ideas are correct. Play with the materials and the concepts and ask new questions.  In this course, you might even be invited to explore a question you posed instead of the one the teacher originally posed!  Mathematics is not just about finding the answer; even when there is an answer, our work should evoke new questions: Why? What else?</div>
