<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">line</dfn> is a one-dimensional figure consisting of a set of points. It does not have any thickness. Because a line extends infinitely in both directions and has no endpoints, we cannot measure the length of a line. For any two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both of them so we may refer to a line by a pair of points on the line, <span class="process-math">\(\overleftrightarrow{AB}\)</span> or by a single lower case letter such as <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span>
