</h4> <div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">angle</dfn> is the union of two rays with a common endpoint. In particular, <span class="process-math">\(\angle ABC\)</span> consists of all points that lie on the rays <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{AB}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{AB}\text{.}\)</span> The common endpoint is called the <dfn class="terminology">vertex</dfn> of the angle and the two rays are called the <dfn class="terminology">sides</dfn> of the angle.</div> <div class="para">When we measure an angle, denoted <span class="process-math">\(m\angle ABC\text{,}\)</span> we are measuring how far we would need to rotate one side of the angle around the vertex to meet the other side. This definition introduces some ambiguity as one might rotate clockwise or counterclockwise and we could even rotate multiple times around the vertex. Typically, we will consider the measure of an angle to be a number between 0 and 180 but there will be some exceptions. When we study symmetry and isometry later in <a href="ch-isom.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Isomorphisms">ChapterÂ 4</a>, we will allow a wider variety of rotations. In addition, we might speak of the interior of some angles of a concave polygon as having at least one interior angle with a measure between 180 and 360 degrees.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-polygons-angles.html#def-angles" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
