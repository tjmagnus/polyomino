<div class="para">Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful beauty; to be alive.</div> <div class="para">If we were to teach music via lecture and mere recall, focusing on the notation and structure, but not allowing students to experience and create music, the subject would be dry and uninteresting, the creative process would be stifled, and very few would have an interest in learning music.  Yet, that is what we have done with much of our mathematics instruction. We have removed both the exploration and the fun. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Lockhart.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.5.1: A Mathematician’s Lament: How School Cheats Us Out of Our Most Fascinating and Imaginative Art Form">[1.5.1]</a>
