<div class="para">Notice how the author Sid introduces the reader to what will be demonstrated, uses a picture to help the reader visualize the explanation, and then explains in words how the picture justifies the argument. In this example, Sid had to deal with the fact that we typically use the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in algebra to represent any real number but the variable <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> representing whole numbers appeared in the sketch. Aunt Josephine was alerted to the fact that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> would would be used in place of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and Sid consistantly used <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in the logical argument. The author could have drawn a new sketch and relabeled it with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in place of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> but chose not to do so. Since the author is using the sketch from the activity, a citation reference should be included. In fact, if a tool like Polypad or GeoGebra is used to create a sketch, the technology should be credited. Also, note how Aunt Josephine did not have to see the questions in the activity to understand Sidâ€™s explanation.</div>
