<div class="para">Have you ever watched a baby learn a new skill, like walking, crawling, or even rolling over? The child does not master the skill on the first try, but they are determined. They fall down, but they keep trying. They readjust what they are doing, figure out how to create momentum and balance, and finally succeed. Even then they may stumble, but they persist. In the process, they grow stronger and can apply these skills to later learning, like running, climbing the cabinets, reaching the cookie jar.</div>
