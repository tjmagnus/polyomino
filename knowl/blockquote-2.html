<div class="para">Dear Aunt Josephine,</div> <div class="para">I have been thinking about you a lot lately and how much I appreciated your help when I was learning algebra. You may remember how much I struggled with understanding why <span class="process-math">\((x+1)^2\)</span> equals <span class="process-math">\(x^2+2x+1\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(x^2+1\)</span> in that course. In my current geometry course, I learned a geometric argument for that equation that makes more sense to me and I thought you might like it too.</div> <div class="para">In the picture below, you can see a square with side <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> broken up into four rectangles. (Here, I am using <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in place of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>) The area of this square is <span class="process-math">\((n+1)^2\)</span> of course. Notice that <span class="process-math">\(n^2+1\)</span> is the sum of the areas of the <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> square (top left) and the small <span class="process-math">\(1\times 1\)</span> square (lower right). These do not fill the entire square so <span class="process-math">\((n+1)^2\)</span> must be greater than <span class="process-math">\(n^2+1\text{.}\)</span> The two missing pieces are rectangles with area <span class="process-math">\(n\times 1=n\text{.}\)</span> Adding all four pieces, we see <span class="process-math">\((n+1)^2=n^2+2n+1\text{.}\)</span>
