<div class="para">Since this textbook is written for students majoring in fields other than mathematics, we will not spend time developing proof-writing techniques. Even so, everyone can benefit from learning to write clear and thorough explanations and demonstrations. Future teachers should develop the ability to explain mathematics carefully and accurately, using words, pictures, and multiple approaches that their students can understand. A future lawyer or business professional will use a different style, but the practice of writing explanatory papers in mathematics will enhance their ability to present and support arguments for their cases and proposals. As you write explanations, choose an audience that makes sense for you--a student, a friend, a colleague--and use language appropriate for that audience.</div>
