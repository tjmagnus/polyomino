<div class="para">Most people can state the Pythagorean Theorem and use it to find missing lengths in a right triangle, but in this section you have learned why the theorem holds for all right triangles. We have practiced using variables in our arguments so that our explanation is not just shown for a right triangle with lengths 3, 4, and 5 (or 5, 12, and 13), but for all right triangles. Even so, the fact that we used puzzle pieces enables us to share this knowledge with anyone who has at least a fourth grade knowledge of geometry, area, and square numbers. A few of our proofs did not require the algebraic representation and symbolic manipulation learned in middle or high school.</div>
