</h4> <div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">line</dfn> is a one-dimensional figure consisting of a set of points. It does not have any thickness. Because a line extends infinitely in both directions and has no endpoints, we cannot measure the length of a line. For any two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both of them so we may refer to a line by a pair of points on the line, <span class="process-math">\(\overleftrightarrow{AB}\)</span> or by a single lower case letter such as <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">When we talk about measuring length, we are referring to a line segment. A <dfn class="terminology">line segment</dfn> is a part of a line consisting of a pair of endpoints and all of the points on the line between the two endpoints. For example, line segment <span class="process-math">\(\overline{AB}\)</span> consists of points <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and all points on line <span class="process-math">\(\overleftrightarrow{AB}\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">In a similar way, we define <dfn class="terminology">ray</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{AB}\)</span> to consist of point <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> point <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and all points on line <span class="process-math">\(\overleftrightarrow{AB}\)</span> which are on the same side of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as point <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> A ray extends infinitely in one direction, has a single endpoint, and cannot be measured.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-polygons-angles.html#def-linesegmentray" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
