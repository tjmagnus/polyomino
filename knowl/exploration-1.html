<div class="introduction"><div class="para">Although this task is to fix a box, you are encouraged to think outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect as you respond to the "why" questions and sharing your ideas with your classmates will also contribute greatly to your learning. Have fun!</div></div>

<div class="para">Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a <dfn class="terminology">tetromino</dfn> is a flat figure created by joining four congruent squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape, and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain why you believe the tiling is impossible.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/whichtetromino.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Four shapes each formed by joining four unit squares along edges: one tall rectangle, one T-shape, one zigzag-shape, and a small square.
