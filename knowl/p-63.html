<div class="para">Hopefully as you worked through these tasks, you allowed yourself to experiment with different arrangements of squares and polyominoes. This openness to creative exploration is essential to mathematical thinking. Phrases like "what if" or "I wonder" arise often as mathematicians create and make sense of new ideas. If you find yourself wanting to explore a question arising from a task but not explicitly asked, jot down your question and share it with your instructor. Your instructor might encourage you to investigate your question or even invite your classmates to consider it.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-14-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.1.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>
