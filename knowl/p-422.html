<div class="para">The Pythagorean Theorem is very useful, but it is also somewhat mysterious. Why does the formula work for all right triangles? Surprisingly, there are more than 350 recognized proofs of the Pythagorean. We will look at just a few. In the following exploration, you will rearrange polygons built from a right triangle, and use the rearrangements to explain why <span class="process-math">\(a^2+b^2=c^2\)</span> in each case. You are encouraged to try all the proofs and to choose one to learn well enough to convince others.</div>
