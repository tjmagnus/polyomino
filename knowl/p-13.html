<div class="para">Geometry is all around us, in nature, in architecture, in art, in games, and in technology. Throughout history, humans have marveled upon geometrical patterns, investigated possibilities, developed geometrical tools, and shared these discoveries with others. Mathematicians use logic to confirm what they appear to see and to convince other scholars. Over time, the study of geometry evolved to the collection of axioms, theorems, and formulas that you may have studied in previous classes.</div>
