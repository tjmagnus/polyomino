<div class="para">Although you may already know some of the facts and formulas from previous coursework, we will develop a toolbox from the ground up, starting with basic principles and assumptions that are intuitively obvious. With many geometric formulas and theorems, we will want to explore why these are true before adding them to our toolbox. Currently our course toolbox only contains the three principles, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/intro-explore-principle-areameaning.html" title="Principle 1.2.1">Principle 1.2.1</a>, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/intro-explore-principle-arearect.html" title="Principle 1.2.2">Principle 1.2.2</a>, and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/intro-explore-principle-areasums.html" title="Principle 1.2.3">Principle 1.2.3</a> from <a href="sec-intro-explore.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Invitation to Explore">Section 1.2</a>. In other words, we can think about the area of a region as the number of <span class="process-math">\(1\times1\)</span> blocks that fills the interior, we can use the area formula for a rectangle, and we know that the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. We will also include in our toolbox all of the algebraic rules and procedures that allow us to perform calculations, simplify expressions, and solve equations. Eventually we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean theorem, area formulas for other shapes, and other geometrical theorems and formulas, but the reasons behind these will be explored in future sections and based on the initial three principles.</div>
