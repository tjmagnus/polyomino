<div class="para">Perhaps this course would be easier for you if you were simply told how to solve the problems, but the objective of this course is not to learn facts and methods, but rather to develop your mathematical thinking and communication skills.  In this technological age, computers can do many of the algorithms and processes that used to be the core of mathematics education, but they have not replaced manâ€™s role of developing strategies to solve problems and recognizing when mathematics can be applied to real world situations.  Developing these reasoning skills will help you more in your future than simply being able to quote the Pythagorean Theorem. On the other hand, it is still useful to know the Pythagorean Theorem so that you are able to recognize when it can (and cannot) be used to solve both elementary and complex problems.  This theorem along with some other basic formulas you have learned in the past (and can look up online) form a toolbox for our work, but we will give more emphasis to the creative process that is mathematics.</div>
