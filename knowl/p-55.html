<div class="para">Although you already know some of the facts and formulas, we will develop a toolbox from the ground up in this course, starting with basic principles and assumptions that are intuitively obvious. With geometric formulas and theorems, we will want to explore why these are true before adding them to our toolbox. When we need to assume a statement without proving it, we will acknowledge the assumption and identify it as a principle rather than a theorem. Theorems will be justified logically from the principles and previously proved theorems. Definitions are developed to give us helpful terminology and state the characteristics needed to identify the object. We typically do not include every property of an object in the definition; some properties can be proved from the initial definition. For example, we define a rectangle to be a quadraliteral with four right angles. The property that opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent is not included in the definition, because it can be proved from the definition.</div>
