<div class="para">To think of the measure of an angle as the space between the rays is vague and misleading. The area between the rays is infinite. Note also that the points <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> on the sides of <span class="process-math">\(\angle{BAC}\)</span> do not play a role in defining or measuring the angle. If <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is any other point on ray <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{AB}\)</span> other than <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\angle{DAC}\)</span> is the same angle as <span class="process-math">\(\angle{BAC}\)</span> and hence have the same measure. Thus it would make no sense to use the linear distance between <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> for measuring <span class="process-math">\(\angle{BAC}\text{.}\)</span> The sides of an angle are infinite and beyond what can be drawn.</div>
