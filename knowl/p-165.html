<div class="para">How does your (de)construction demonstrate that the area formula for a trapezoid is <span class="process-math">\(A_{trap}=\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h\text{?}\)</span> The steps that follow will assist you in forming a convincing argument.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<div class="para">Choose one of the constructions or deconstructions you created in the previous task. Label the height of the trapezoid with the variable <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> The summit and base of the trapezoid are typically labeled <span class="process-math">\(b_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_2\text{,}\)</span> but you are free to name them <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> if you would like to avoid subscripts. You could instead call the summit <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b'\text{.}\)</span> Once you select your labels, you will use them consistently for the remainder of this activity. In my discussion, I will use <span class="process-math">\(b_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_2\)</span> to represent the summit and base.</div>
<aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">You could even name the summit <span class="process-math">\(Sidney\)</span> if you desire. On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(Sidney\)</span> is a bit long to use in diagrams and formulas.</div></aside>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Now identify any parts of your other shapes that must have the same length as your trapezoid’s height, base, or summit because of the way they were constructed. Label them with the appropriate variable to indicate this equality. Be careful!</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(Skip if this doesn’t apply to your (de)construction.) If you created any triangles, rectangles, or parallelograms which have, or might have, different base length or height, you will need to give these lengths new, different labels. If you find that you need to create a lot of new labels, you might want to use a different construction or deconstruction to reduce the amount of algebra you will need to do later.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(Skip if this doesn’t apply to your (de)construction.) Relate any new labels to the trapezoid’s height, base, and/or summit. For example, if you split the base into three segments, labeled <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> you would write down the relationship <span class="process-math">\(x+y+z=b_2\text{.}\)</span> If you split the base into two segments, one of which is congruent to the summit, you would write <span class="process-math">\(x+b_1=b_2\)</span> or equivalently, <span class="process-math">\(b_1=b_2-x\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Compute the areas of any rectangles, parallelograms, or triangles in your construction/deconstruction, leaving variables in your expressions for each area. Be careful to use the variables assigned in your sketch which may be different than the variables in the standard formulas. For example, if you created an upside-down triangle, its base may be the summit of the trapezoid, and so we would use the label <span class="process-math">\(b_1\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>) instead of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Write a draft of how your (de)construction shows that the area of any trapezoid must be <span class="process-math">\(A_{trap}=\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(b_1\)</span> is the length of the summit, <span class="process-math">\(b_2\)</span> is the length of the base, and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is the height. You may be asked to write this explanation up more formally outside of class.</div></li>
