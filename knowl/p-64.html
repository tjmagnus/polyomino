<div class="para">You may have noticed that you and your peers discovered different ways of completing the same task. Multiple approaches and multiple solutions are often welcome and even encouraged! If you have a strategy that is different than your group members, try both separately and then compare. You have the ability to do the mathematics, but it will be more meaningful if you attack tasks in a way that makes sense to you. This will require you and your peers to take some risks, to challenge you to speak up, and to be nonjudgmental of others.</div>
