<div class="para">As we share our solutions with others, it is important to use the equals sign appropriately. Check that the two expressions on either side of the symbol <span class="process-math">\(=\)</span> are really equal to each other.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">A frequent error made by students is to link steps of a computation with equals signs when the two expressions are not equal to each other. Typically, an operation has been performed in a step which did not exist previously. For example, a student simplifying <span class="process-math">\((x+3)^2-6x\)</span> may write</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
(x+3)^2-6x\amp = 34=x^2+6x+9-6x = 34\\
\amp = x^2+9=34=x^2=25= x=\pm 5.
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Why is this incorrect? Near the end of the line, we see <span class="process-math">\(25=x=\pm 5\text{.}\)</span> This would imply that <span class="process-math">\(25=\pm 5\text{,}\)</span> a statement that is clearly false. It appears that the student has taken the square root of both sides of <span class="process-math">\(x^2=25\)</span> but that operation changes the value. While <span class="process-math">\(x=\pm 5\)</span> is the solution of <span class="process-math">\(x^2=25\text{,}\)</span> the expression <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is not equal to <span class="process-math">\(25\)</span> so they should not be linked with an equals sign.</div>
