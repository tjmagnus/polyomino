<div class="introduction"><div class="para">For this activity and the one that follows, you will need a small sphere, some rubber bands large enough to go around your sphere, a protractor, a marker, and a piece of thread. Possible “spheres” include styrofoam balls, oranges, rubber balls, or spheres sold by math education supply companies. Aim for a sphere around the size of a softball. A smooth surface is best, but any small ball will suffice. As an alternative, you may use a ribbon with a globe where latitude and longitude lines are marked.</div></div>

<div class="para">We do not live on a plane; we live on a sphere. Let’s predict what objects on a sphere might act as lines. These lines will lie on the surface of the sphere. They will not pass through the sphere nor will they project out into space. What are some examples of things that might pose as “lines” on a sphere? Which of your descriptions in <a href="sec-polygons-parallel.html#parallel-task-describe-line" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/parallel-task-describe-line.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Task 2.3.1.a">Task 2.3.1.a</a> do they satisfy?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">You have probably heard the expression, “The shortest distance between two points lies along a line.” We shall use this property of line segment to determine which linear features on a sphere act as lines and line segments. Suppose you have plans to fly from Chicago, Illinois (41.8781N, 87.6298W) to Rome, Italy (41.9028N,12.4964E). There are many paths you could take; some might qualify as lines under your suggestions above. Which path gives the shortest distance from Chicago to Rome?  If a globe is available, find Chicago and Rome and experiment with a string to find the path of least distance. If you do not have a globe, mark the approximate locations of Chicago and Rome on your sphere; each should be midway between the equator and the North Pole, with Rome approximately a quarter of the way around east of Chicago. Tighten the string connecting these two cities to observe the path of shortest distance between them.</div>
