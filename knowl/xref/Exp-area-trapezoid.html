<div class="para">Choose one of the constructions or deconstructions you created in the previous task.

Once you select your labels for the height, base, and summit, you should use them consistently for the remainder of this activity. In fact, these labels will only be used for lengths known to be equal to the height, base, and summit of the original trapezoid.</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">You might call the summit <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and the base <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Others may use <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b'\text{.}\)</span> You could even name the summit <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(Elizabeth\)</span> if you desire.

<div class="para">Now identify any parts of your other shapes that must have the same length as your trapezoid’s height, base, or summit because of the way they were constructed. Label them with the appropriate variable to indicate this equality. Be careful!</div>
