<div class="para">Depending on the level of a geometry textbook and the authorâ€™s goals, you will see some differences between the statements of geometric definitions and principles (also called axioms). For this reason, a proof you find elsewhere may not be sufficient here due to its reliance on different assumptions. Students are encouraged to use the resources in this text for their work. In addition, you should be mindful of the order in which theorems are introduced as you cannot use a theorem that comes later in the textbook as an argument in a proof. On the other hand, this textbook is not as rigorous as some geometry textbooks. In order to maintain the exploratory and intuitive nature of this book, the author will include some principles here that might appear as proved theorems in other texts. At times, proofs may be included as exercises leaving the choice of rigor up to the course instructor.</div>
