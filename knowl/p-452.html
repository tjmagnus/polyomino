<div class="para">This activity may have involved more of a struggle that some of the others. Perhaps you only found about half of the possibilities in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/srtiling-possible-vertex-arrangements.html" title="Task 2.4.2.e">Task 2.4.2.e</a> or you cannot yet see a pattern to help determine which vertex arrangements lead to a semiregular tiling. That is perfectly normal. Write down the ideas that you do have and share them with classmates. As you share what you have observed and listen to others’ discoveries, you and your classmates may uncover some amazing results.</div>
