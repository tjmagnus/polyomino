<div class="para">If today was not your day to shine, perhaps you were hesitant to consider alternative approaches or to pursue your ideas. This particular topic might not have engaged you in the same way as it did others. There will be more opportunities to overcome challenges throughout this book, and so long as you are open to learning, there will be some that will connect more with you. After all, the course has just started and you are just getting to know the book and its style, your instructor and your classmates. By the way, your brain may hurt a little as you confront and conquer mathematical challenges. Like every other muscle in your body, a little soreness means that you are growing in strength. Success comes from overcoming the struggle, from remembering and building on the accomplishments.</div>
