  "title": "Invitation to Explore",
  "body": " Invitation to Explore   To The Student  This class may be different from many of the mathematics classes you have taken in the past. You will be encouraged to explore geometrical ideas, solve puzzles, make conjectures, discuss with classmates, make connections between ideas, explain your solutions, and justify your reasoning. You should not expect to be shown how to do problems by the instructions. In fact, there may not be one, single right way to complete some of the problems but rather many acceptable ways of coming to a solution. Your teacher will encourage you to share these alternative approaches with the class.  Perhaps this course would be easier for you if you were simply told how to solve the problems, but the objective of this course is not to learn facts and methods, but rather to develop your mathematical thinking and communication skills. In this technological age, computers can do many of the algorithms and processes that used to be the core of mathematics education, but they have not replaced man’s role of developing strategies to solve problems and recognizing when mathematics can be applied to real world situations. Developing these reasoning skills will help you more in your future than simply being able to quote the Pythagorean Theorem. On the other hand, it is still useful to know the Pythagorean Theorem so that you are able to recognize when it can (and cannot) be used to solve both elementary and complex problems. This theorem along with some other basic formulas you have learned in the past (and can look up online) form a toolbox for our work, but we will give more emphasis to the creative process that is mathematics.  In A Mathematician’s Lament Paul Lockhart describes a nightmare in which music was taught in the same way that mathematics is currently taught. He says,   Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful beauty; to be alive.  If we were to teach music via lecture and mere recall, focusing on the notation and structure, but not allowing students to experience and create music, the subject would be dry and uninteresting, the creative process would be stifled, and very few would have an interest in learning music. Yet, that is what we have done with much of our mathematics instruction. We have removed both the exploration and the fun.    So I encourage you to embrace the experience that is mathematics. Approach each puzzle with an open mind, make guesses as to what is happening, and experiment to determine whether your ideas are correct. Play with the materials and the concepts and ask new questions. In this course, you might even be invited to explore a question you posed instead of the one the teacher originally posed! Mathematics is not just about finding the answer; even when there is an answer, our work should evoke new questions: Why? What else?    First Exploration   Tiling Rectangles with Polyominoes   Although this task is to fill a box, you are encouraged to think outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect as you respond to the \"why\" questions and sharing your ideas with your classmates will also contribute greatly to your learning. Have fun!    Fill the blue square with non-overlapping copies of the green L-shaped tetronimo. How many tetrominos are required?  To use the interactive tool, click and drag the L-shape to create a new copy of the shape. Use the large dot, to rotate the copy. Arrange copies to cover the blue square. This may also be done on paper.     Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon      Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a tetromino  tetromino  polyomino  tetromino is a flat figure created by joining four congruent squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape, and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain why you believe the tiling is impossible.  Once again in the application, copies of the I-shape, Z-shape, T-shape, and small square can be created by clicking the shape and dragging. Four larger squares are provided; try to tile one with the I-shape, one with the Z-shape, etc.      Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon      Since a tetromino is formed by joining four unit squares, each tetromino has an area of four square units, as illustrated here.   The L-tetromino drawn as a joining of four square tiles.   What is the area of the square that you filled with tetrominoes?    Similarly, we define a pentomino  pentomino  polyomino pentomino to be a figure formed by joining five congruent squares along edges. One pentomino is pictured. Create new pentominoes by copying and moving the provided purple unit square. Note that if two pentominos are reflections or rotations of each other we consider them to be the same pentomino.    Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon     There are twelve different pentominoes. Did you find them all?   The pentominoes may be labeled as F, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z. Can you figure out which is which?    Use some of the pentominoes you created to build solid rectangles.   What dimensions are possible? Does it matter whether you restrict yourself to never using a pentomino more than once in a rectangle?    Can you build a rectangle that uses every pentomino exactly once?   The hint below gives access to an interactive tool.   Use the interactive Polypad activity below or access a fullscreen version at Polypad by Mathigon using the link Pentomino Set .     Are there any rectangles that cannot be filled using only pentominoes? Why?    As you participated in this exploration, what did you wonder? What did you notice about area?   There is no right or wrong answer here! Write something!      Reflections on the Exploration  The purpose of is two-fold. It introduces the exploratory nature of the course and it also suggests a few important geometric facts that we will use as our initial geometrical foundation. These facts are chosen because they are intuitively obvious, but they give us some building blocks we will need to justify more complex ideas. We state them here for clarity and future reference.   area   The area of a closed figure in the plane is the number of unit squares needed to fill the figure without any gaps or overlaps.      Area of a Rectangle   The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width; in symbols, .     Additivity of Area   If a region can be cut into non-overlapping sections, the area of the whole region is equal to the sum of the areas of the sections.    Hopefully as you worked through this task, you allowed yourself to experiment with different arrangements of squares and polyominoes. This openness to exploration is essential to mathematical thinking. Phrases like \"what if\" or \"I wonder\" arise often as mathematicians create and make sense of new ideas.  In addition, mathematics is a social activity. When we notice patterns and make conjectures, we share our ideas with others and use logic to make convincing arguments. For over 2500 years, mathematicians have been adding to the body of mathematical knowledge; some of which has been shared with you during your studies. The field of mathematics continues to grow.  Unfortunately, most students have had little opportunity to creatively explore in their mathematics classes. You have probably memorized formulas and performed calculations in many of your mathematics classes. While formulas and calculations are useful tools in mathematics, they are not the essence of mathematics and can often be done via a computer. In this course, we will develop the creative thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving practices that set humans apart computers and are valued by employers. We will think outside the box, make predictions, and wonder why. Different approaches and strategies are encouraged. Relax and have fun exploring mathematics!    Exercises   The following definition will be useful in the exercises for this section.   polyomino  triomino  hexomino  pentomino  tetromino   A polyomino is a flat geometric figure formed by gluing equal-sized squares together along their edges. A triomino consists of three squares, a tetromino consists of four squares, a pentomino consists of five squares, and a hexomino consists of six squares.      Sketch the two distinct triominos.   The two triominos will be distinct if they cannot be rotated or slid to land on top of each other.     "

  "title": "Invitation to Apply Knowledge",
  "body": " Invitation to Apply Knowledge   Building a Course Toolbox  Throughout our learning, and in fact throughout our lives, we add knowledge to our toolkit that we can later reference as needed. The tools in our toolkit can then be used to solve problems, to further build our understanding of related concepts, and to support the validity of an argument. Most likely, you are already familiar with some of these tools from previous coursework. You know how to perform computations, have used geometric formulas, and can recognize many shapes.  Although you already know some of the facts and formulas, we will develop a toolbox from the ground up in this course, starting with basic principles and assumptions that are intuitively obvious. With geometric formulas and theorems, we will want to explore why these are true before adding them to our toolbox. When we need to assume a statement without proving it, we will acknowledge the assumption and identify it as a principle rather than a theorem. Theorems will be justified logically from the principles and previously proved theorems. Definitions are developed to give us helpful terminology and state the characteristics needed to identify the object. We typically do not include every property of an object in the definition; some properties can be proved from the initial definition. For example, we define a rectangle to be a quadraliteral with four right angles. The property that opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent is not included in the definition, because it can be proved from the definition.  Depending on the level of a geometry textbook and the author's goals, you will see some differences between the statements of geometric definitions and principles (also called axioms). For this reason, a proof you find elsewhere may not be sufficient here due to its reliance on different assumptions. Students are encouraged to use the resources in this text for their work. In addition, you should be mindful of the order in which theorems are introduced as you cannot use a theorem that comes later in the textbook as an argument in a proof. On the other hand, this textbook is not as rigorous as some geometry textbooks. In order to maintain the exploratory and intuitive nature of this book, the author will include some principles here that might appear as proved theorems in other texts. At times, proofs may be included as exercises leaving the choice of rigor up to the course instructor.   Currently our course toolbox only contains the definition of area and two principles, and from . In other words, we can think about the area of a region as the number of blocks that fills the interior, we can use the area formula for a rectangle, and we know that the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. Hopefully, you will agree that length should also be additive; namely, that if we extend a segment of length by a segment of length , the resulting segment has length . We restate this below:   To view the statements of the earlier principles, click on each corresponding link. .    Additivity of Length   Suppose that is a point on the interior of line segment , then the length of equals the sum of the lengths of and .    We will also include in our toolbox all of the algebraic rules and procedures that allow us to perform calculations, simplify expressions, and solve equations. Eventually we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean theorem, area formulas for other shapes, and other geometrical theorems and formulas, but the reasons behind these will be explored in future sections and based on definitions and the initial principles.  As we encounter and state new definitions, these too will be added to our tool box. As you work through the next exploration, you will encounter terms like trapezoid and isosceles. Definitions for these and other terms are provided at the end of this section in case you would like to refresh your memory. You can also use the index or textbook's search tool to find definitions.   Explorations with Tangrams   In this exploration, use the tools currently in our toolbox as you answer the questions. You may find yourself wanting to use the Pythagorean theorem and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions without these formulas. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean theorem, there is probably an easier method!  A set of tangrams consists of the following seven pieces, two large triangles, one medium triangle, a parallelogram, a square, and two small triangles.   The Seven Tangrams   Seven tangram shapes. The triangles are all isosceles right triangles and the parallelogram is equilateral. The small triangles can be arranged to fill either the square, the parallelogram, or the medium triangle. The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same as the base of the large triangle.    To complete this exploration, you will need to move the seven Tangram pieces around. If you do not have a set of Tangrams, you may print and cut out the shapes shown above. A tangram interactive is also availabe on Polypad by Mathigon via the link Interactive Tangrams on Polypad by Mathigon .    Assume that the length of each side of the square is 1 unit. Determine the area of each of the figures:   The area of the square.    The area of one small triangle.    The area of the parallelogram.    The area of the medium triangle.    The area of the large triangle.       Still assuming that length of each side of the square is 1 unit, now find the lengths of the sides of the other tangram shapes. You may use the Pythagorean Theorem, but it is possible to determine these lengths without it!    Construct each of the following if possible:   A triangle using three tangram pieces.    A rectangle    A parallelogram that is not a rectangle using two pieces.    A non-isosceles trapezoid (you choose the number of pieces).    A pentagon.    A non-square rectangle using all seven pieces.    A square using all seven pieces.   What is the area of this square?    What is the side length of this square?          Were you able to answer the questions above without using the Pythagorean theorem or the area formula for a triangle? If not, explore how this might be done!   What tools do we have in our toolbox? How can these help?    In this exercise, we have practiced using our initial principles and identified some tools, namely the Pythagorean Theorem and the area formula for a triangle, that will be developed later. We also noted that there are multiple ways to solve a problem. Solutions do not need to use formulas and should evolve from what we know and what we have in our toolbox. Still, we want to grow our toolbox to increase our ability to solve problems and justify claims.  Perhaps you moved figures around and lined up sides to determine whether the lengths were the same.     Defining Polygons  In the first part of this course, we will work primarily with polygons. What is a polygon? Giving a clear, clean definition of the word \"polygon\" is difficult so we will describe it verbally and give several examples. If you search for the definition in books or on the web, you will find different attempts to give a clear definition. We will describe a polygon  polygon as being a closed plane figure formed by a sequence of straight sides. Thus, a polygon is a shape that lies in the plane or on a flat surface. By closed, we mean that a polygon will have a well-defined interior; the polygon forms a solid boundary between this interior and the rest of the plane.   Some examples of polygons    A right trapezoid   (for accessibility)     A concave pentagon.       Examples of figures that are not polygons    Not closed.   A figure formed by line segments with a gap remaining.     Curved edges   A closed figure consisting of some straight sides and some curved sides.      Some specific types of polygons are defined below. We add these to our toolbox. An easy way to find definitions later is to use the index at the end of the textbook.    triangle  polygon triangle   A triangle is a polygon with exactly three sides.     quadrilateral  polygon quadrilateral   A quadrilateral is a polygon with exactly four sides.     polygon n-gon  polygon pentagon  polygon octagon  polygon decagon  n-gon  pentagon  octagon  decagon   A pentagon is a polygon n-gon with five sides. A hexagon has six sides. We use the general term -gon to describe a polygon with exactly sides. Other common numerical prefixes used to describe polygons include octa (eight) and deca (ten). These will be explored more in .    Some polygons are defined by the types of angles they have.   right angle  acute angle  obtuse angle  angle right  angle acute  angle obtuse   An angle is said to be a right angle if its measure is 90 degrees. Angles that have measures less than 90 degrees are said to be acute and angles with measures greater than 90 degrees are said to be obtuse .     triangle right  triangle acute  triangle obtuse  right triangle  acute triangle  obtuse triangle   A triangle is said to be a right triangle if one of its angles is a right angle. If one of its angles is obtuse, we say that the triangle is an obtuse triangle . An acute triangle is a triangle with three acute angles. We will explore the measurement of angles more in and .     quadrilateral rectangle  quadrilateral square  rectangle  square   A quadrilateral with four right angles is called a rectangle A square is a rectangle whose sides are all the same length.     equiangular   A polygon is said to be equiangular if all of its angles have the same measure.    Quadrilaterals may also be described by the existance of parallel sides.   parallel lines  parallel sides of a polygon   Two lines in the same plane are said to be parallel if they never intersect. Two line segments or two sides of a polygon are said to be parallel if the lines they are a part of are parallel. Note that a line always extends infinitely in two directions while a line segment has endpoints.     parallelogram  quadrilateral parallelogram  parallelogram altitude  parallelogram base  altitude parallelogram  base parallelogram   A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. When describing the measurements of a parallelogram, it is useful to identify one side as the base . The height of the parallelogram is measured along an altitude , namely a segment formed connecting a point on the side opposite the base to a point on the base such that the altitude meets the base at a right angle.     trapezoid  quadrilateral trapezoid  trapezoid altitude  trapezoid base  altitude trapezoid  base trapezoid   A quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides is called a trapezoid . One of the parallel sides is called the base and the other is called the summit . The height of a trapezoid is the distance between the base and the summit, measured along an altitude which is perpendicular to the base.    Triangles and other polygons may also be classified by whether some of their sides have the same length. Two sides of a polygon are said to be congruent  congruent sides if they are the same length.   equilateral triangle  equilateral quadrilateral  rhombus  quadrilateral rhombus  triangle equilateral   A polygon is described as being equilateral if all of its sides are congruent. An equilateral quadrilateral is called a rhombus .     isosceles  isosceles triangle  isosceles trazezoid  triangle isosceles  trapezoid isosceles   The word isosceles comes from two Greek words, isos meaning equal and skelos meaning leg . An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two congruent sides. An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid with two congruent, non-parallel sides.     Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles  Some textbooks will restrict the term isosceles triangle to a triangle with exactly two congruent sides while others allow two or all three of the sides to be congruent. This latter definition is used when one is one wants to argue that properties of isosceles triangles extend to equilateral triangles.   Should you become a teacher, it is wise to be mindful of how your textbook uses these terms. In the early sections of this text, we will distinguish between isosceles and equilateral triangles when you are asked to sketch and identify examples. When we explore properties of triangles, you may use the fact that properties of an isosceles triangle will also hold for equilateral triangles.  In case you are curious, equilateral comes from Latin and French words meaning equal sides.    scalene  triangle scalene   A triangle with no congruent sides is said to be a scalene triangle .     kite  quadrilateral kite   A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent congruent sides. A kite has reflective (fold) symmetry across one of its diagonals.    We also distinguish between convex and concave polygons.   convex  concave  polygon convex  polygon concave   A polygon is convex polygon if every interior angle has a measure less than 180 degrees. If a polygon is not convex, then it is concave .     "

Explain how you came up with your formula and why you believe it holds for all . If you were not able to come up with a formula, describe what you have discovered about these sums.      Conjectures and Explanations in Mathematics  Have you ever wondered how mathematics came into existence? A simple answer is that people explored mathematical objects, like numbers or shapes, and noticed patterns and consistencies. They then sought to convince themselves and others that these patterns were not just coincidences but would have to occur.  How do we convince others? In mathematics, we start with basic assumptions like the principles and definitions in this text and then use logic to demonstrate that our conjecture must follow. We also accept the algebraic properties of the real number system along with properties of equality and inequality, allowing us to simplify algebraic expressions and solving linear equalities and inequalities using techniques learned in previous courses. Once we prove a claim, it is no longer a conjecture and is now considered to be a theorem. We can then add the theorem to our toolbox and use it to demonstrate new claims.  Since this textbook is written for students majoring in fields other than mathematics, we will not spend time developing proof-writing techniques. Even so, everyone can benefit from learning to write clear and thorough explanations and demonstrations. Future teachers should develop the ability to explain mathematics carefully and accurately, using words, pictures, and multiple approaches that their students can understand. For a future lawyer or business professional, the practice of writing explanatory papers in mathematics will enhance their ability to present and support arguments for their cases and proposals. As you write explanations, choose an audience that makes sense for you--a student, a friend, a colleague, a jury --and use language appropriate for that audience.  How do we write mathematical explanations and establish new truths? We usually let our reader know what we claim and plan to prove. In geometry, we often accompany our explanations with a sketch on which we have labeled with the names of points and\/or variables for lengths so that our reader can follow our argument visually. We do not assign numerical values to lengths as we do not want to limit our claim to one example.  In , we discovered a formula for the sum of the first odd numbers. It appears to equal , but why? Simply observing the pattern via a few examples, does not convince us that this will also be the case for . Something strange might happen between 5 and 1000. Instead, consider the following proof by pictures :    The first four steps of a pattern are provided.   A geometric pattern.   First, a 1 by 1 square. Second, four 1 by 1 squares arranged to form a 2 by 2 square. Third, a 2 by 2 square with a horizontal 1 by 2 rectangle added to the bottom and a vertical 2 by 1 rectangle added to the right and a 1 unit square in the lower right corner filled in. Finally, a 3 by 3 square has a 1 by 3 rectangle added to the bottom edge, a 3 by 1 rectangle added along the right edge, and a 1 unit square in the lower right corner.    Sketch what the fifth and sixth step of the pattern should look like.   One way of computing the area of the figure in each step is to measure the height and width and multiply. For step one we get , and for step two we get . Use this technique to determine the area of   the third figure.    the fourth figure.    the fifth figure.    the sixth figure.      The area of the third figure can also be found by computing the area of each of the four rectangles that make up the figure, namely . Show and compute the sum of the smaller rectangles   the fourth figure.    the fifth figure.    the sixth figure.        The image to the right shows an -square with two rectangles aligned with the lower and right sides, respectively. The lower right corner has been filled with a 1-unit square.   An arbitrary step in the pattern.     Write the following as unsimplified algebraic expressions with the variable :   The total area found by multiplying the height and length of the figure.    The total area found by adding the areas of the four rectangles.       What algebraic equation or formula does this work suggest? Give an explanation of why it must hold using words, pictures, geometry, and\/or algebra.      A Sample Explanatory Letter  The following letter demonstrates how we might write a thorough, yet informal, explanatory letter. Note the use of variables for a general argument and labeled sketches to help the reader follow our argument.   Dear Aunt Josephine,  I have been thinking about you a lot lately and how much I appreciated your help when I was learning algebra. You may remember how much I struggled with understanding why equals instead of in that course. In my current geometry course, I learned a geometric argument for that equation that makes more sense to me and I thought you might like it too.  In the picture below, you can see a square with side broken up into four rectangles. (Here, I am using in place of .) The area of this square is of course. Notice that is the sum of the areas of the square (top left) and the small square (lower right). These do not fill the entire square so must be greater than . The two missing pieces are rectangles with area . Adding all four pieces, we see .    Visualization of     Now that I have seen this geometrically I remember the formula much better!  I hope you and Uncle Tom are doing well. I look forward to visiting you soon.  Sid   Notice how the author Sid introduces the reader to what will be demonstrated, uses a picture to help the reader visualize the explanation, and then explains in words how the picture justifies the argument. In this example, Sid had to deal with the fact that we typically use the variable in algebra to represent any real number but the variable , representing whole numbers appeared in the sketch. Aunt Josephine was alerted to the fact that would would be used in place of and Sid consistantly used in the logical argument. The author could have drawn a new sketch and relabeled it with in place of , but chose not to do so. Since the author is using the sketch from the activity, a citation reference should be included. In fact, if a tool like Polypad or GeoGebra is used to create a sketch, the technology should be credited. Also, note how Aunt Josephine did not have to see the questions in the activity to understand Sid's explanation.   Did you notice the unstated use of in Sid's letter? Explain the role of this principle here.    "

  "body": " Invitation to Overcome Challenges   Growing through Persistance  Have you ever watched a baby learn a new skill, like walking, crawling, or even rolling over? The child does not master the skill on the first try, but they are determined. They fall down, but they keep trying. They readjust what they are doing, figure out how to create momentum and balance, and finally succeed. Even then they may stumble, but they persist. In the process, they grow stronger and can apply these skills to later learning, like running, climbing the cabinets, reaching the cookie jar.  Throughout our lives, we grow by challenging ourselves to move beyond our comfort zone. We learn to read and write, to play games and sports, to cook, make music, or other art. Our brains are muscles that develop as we attempt new challenges. That the nature of mathematics involves struggling with a problem, trying different strategies, taking breaks but persisting. In the explorations in this section, you will find that some of the problems are easy, but others require looking at the problem in new ways and trying different strategies.   Triangles on a Geoboard   You may use tools that you remember from previous courses, such as the area formula for a triangle and the Pythagorean Theorem, as you complete this activity. We will explore why these formulas hold in .    In this exploration, we will work with a geoboard that has four rows and four columns of pins such as the one pictured below.   A grid with 16 dots arranged in four rows and four columns.      Measuring along any row, we will assume that the horizontal distance between neighboring dots on a geoboard is one unit. What is the distance across the top of the geoboard from the leftmost pin to the rightmost pin?    Similarly, the vertical distance between neighboring pins in any column will be one unit. Determine the area of the square whose vertices are the four outermost pins on this geoboard.    Determine the shortest diagonal distance between two pins. In other words, what is the distance from the pin in the upper left corner to the pin in the second row and second column?    What is the distance from the top left pin to the bottom right pin?       As we construct triangles and other shapes on our geoboard, note that each vertex must be one one of the sixteen pins.   An interactive GeoBoard is available at the Polypad by Mathigon, polypad.org\/DLddLdVKLW461A or use the embedded interactive in the hint below.      Construct a triangle with the smallest possible area. What is the area?     Construct a triangle with the largest possible area. Then construct a second triangle with the same area that is not the same shape as the first. Record your sketches and compute this area.      Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon         Construct triangles with an area different than any triangle you've already drawn. Counting the triangles you drew in , it is possible to create a total of eight triangles each with a different area. Be sure to record your sketches of the triangles and their areas for reference.     Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon    The possible areas are .    Extension: If we use a 5x5-geoboard instead, what squares and what triangles are possible? Compute the areas.      Confronting the Challenge  To give you the experience of confronting the challenge and the exhilaration of conquering it, the answer to the last task in this exploration will not be provided here. Searching for solutions or examples will not help you grow mathematically. Instead, consider other ways in which you might attack the problem. Dare to try something new!  The above exploration starts off relatively easy. Once students understand how to create and measure shapes on the geoboard, most can quickly find triangles with areas of , and . In fact, they find multiple triangles with these areas. Yet the remaining areas may seem impossible. At some point they begin to realize why they keep finding triangles with these five areas and begin to think differently about how they might create triangles on the geoboard.  With these new triangles, a new question emerges: How does one compute the area? To use the area formula, , one needs to know the values of and . How does one find and with certainty? Are there other ways of finding the area?  There are many lessons to be learned here that go beyond measuring area. Mathematics is not about doing fast calculations with provided formulas or following steps. Instead, it requires persistance, creative thinking, and multiple strategies. Sometimes it is helpful to walk away from a problem for a little while and to look at it differently when you return to it. It helps to share ideas with others even when you do not know where they will lead.  Did you discover a triangle that was not obvious? Did you think figure out a way to compute the area of these triangles? Did you help others understand? Be proud of your discoveries and contributions. You are a mathematician!  On the other hand, each student brings their own individual strengths to the class. Some are great at remembering and applying formulas, some are great at drawing sketches, some recognize patterns, some build on others' ideas, some explain results and connections. In fact, you may find yourself contributing in different ways on different activities. The important thing is to believe in yourself and be open to trying new things. Unfortunately, most people believe the lie that they can't do math and spend too much energy comparing themselves to others. Math is not about being perfect or fast. Instead it is about exploring, creating, experimenting, conjecturing, applying, and justifying.  If today was not your day to shine, perhaps you were hesitant to consider alternative approaches or to pursue your ideas. This particular topic might not have engaged you in the same way as it did others. Or maybe it was just an off day. There will be more opportunities to overcome challenges throughout this book, and so long as you are open to learning and exploring your own ideas, you will grow in mathematical ability and confidence. After all, the course has just started and you are just getting to know the book and its style, your instructor and your classmates. By the way, your brain may hurt a little as you confront and conquer mathematical challenges. Like every other muscle in your body, a little soreness means that you are growing in strength. Success comes from overcoming the struggle, from remembering and building on the accomplishments.   "

  "body": " Why do the area formulas hold?   In these activities we will determine the area formulas for three shapes, a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be able to explain why they follow from the basic principles. In particular, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle, , as our starting point and derive other area formulas from it.    Area of a Parallelogram   Discovering an Area Formula for a Parallelogram   Refer to the definition of parallogram as needed to complete the following.    Sketch the following:   A parallelogram with two different angle measures and two different lengths.    A parallelogram with a least one acute angle and four congruent sides.    A parallelogram with four congruent angles. What do we usually call this parallelogram?    Two parallelograms which share the same side lengths but have different heights.       Beginning with the parallelogram pictured below or the one you sketched in of , explain and demonstrate how you would construct a rectangle with the same area. You are allowed to cut the parallelogram and rearrange or duplicate pieces as part of your argument.    Building on the previous problem, derive an area formula for a parallelogram. Use a combination of words and pictures to explain how it comes from the area formula for a rectangle and how you know it must work for all parallelograms.   Be sure to label the height and base in your pictures. These lengths should stay the same throughout your explanation and clarify the relationship between your parallelogram and rectangle.    Now that we know the area formula for parallelograms and why it works, we may add it to our toolbox and use it as well as the area formula for a rectangle in the next exploration.    The Area of a Triangle   Discovering the Area Formula for a Triangle   You probably remember the angle formula for a triangle; in fact, you may have used it already in this course! But why is the area ? This exploration will encourage you to answer that question.    Triangles come in all shapes and sizes. Sketch one or more examples of the following types of triangles.   An equilateral triangle.    A right isosceles triangle.    An acute triangle that is not equilateral.    An obtuse scalene triangle.       To demonstrate WHY the formula, , gives the area for any triangle, construct a parallelogram based on the triangle shown below. How is the area of your parallelogram related to the area of the triangle? Explain.   Resist the urge to use numbers instead of the variables, and . Specific triangles will have numerical dimensions, but we want a formula that will work for all triangles, not just the one you have. Variables allow us to generalize formulas.    A scalene triangle.     A friend (or one of your students) asks you why the area formula for a triangle is . Rewrite and elaborate on your answer to the previous task to give a clear, thorough, and cohesive explanation. Be sure to use words and pictures as needed to make the locations of and clear. The relationship between the triangle and the parallelogram needs to be made explicit as well. Do they have the same height and base? Why or why not? Why must their areas be related and how?     The Area of a Trapezoid  We now have three area formulas in our toolbox:   First Three Area Formulas  area of triangle  area of parallelogram  area of rectangle  triangle area  parallelogram area  rectangle area    Shape  Area Formula  Variables    Rectangle   area , length , width    Parallelogram   area , base , height    Triangle   area , base , height     You may use these three formulas in the next exploration as needed.   The Area Formula for a Trapezoid   We now turn to the trapezoid . Once again, we look at some examples before exploring the formula for area.    Sketch example(s) of each of the following trapezoids:   An isosceles trapezoid.    A trapezoid with one right angle.    A trapezoid with one acute base angle and one obtuse base angle.       Use dissection (cutting), duplication, and\/or rearrangement to construct or deconstruct the trapezoid below into one or more rectangles, parallelograms, and\/or triangles. If you found one method, challenge yourself to do this a second way. Perhaps, you can use just triangles or just parallelograms. Briefly describe your construction or deconstruction.   An arbitrary trapezoid, not isosceles and not a right trapezoid.     How does your (de)construction demonstrate that the area formula for a trapezoid is ? The steps that follow will assist you in forming a convincing argument.   Choose one of the constructions or deconstructions you created in the previous task. Label the height of the trapezoid with the variable . The summit and base of the trapezoid are typically labeled and , but you are free to name them and if you would like to avoid subscripts. Once you select your labels, you will use them consistently for the remainder of this activity. In my discussion, I will use and to represent the summit and base.   You could even name the summit or if you desire. On the other hand, is a bit long to use in diagrams and formulas so single letters are usually chosen.     Now identify any parts of your other shapes that must have the same length as your trapezoid's height, base, or summit because of the way they were constructed. Label them with the appropriate variable to indicate this equality. Be careful!    (Skip if this doesn't apply to your (de)construction.) If you created any triangles, rectangles, or parallelograms which have, or might have, different base length or height, you will need to give these lengths new, different labels. If you find that you need to create a lot of new labels, you might want to use a different construction or deconstruction to reduce the amount of algebra you will need to do later.    (Skip if this doesn't apply to your (de)construction.) Relate any new labels to the trapezoid's height, base, and\/or summit. For example, if you split the base into three segments, labeled , , and , you would write down the relationship . If you split the base into two segments, one of which is congruent to the summit, you might write or equivalently, .    Compute the areas of any rectangles, parallelograms, or triangles in your construction\/deconstruction, leaving variables in your expressions for each area. Be careful to use the variables assigned in your sketch which may be different than the variables in the standard formulas. For example, if you created an upside-down triangle, its base may be the summit of the trapezoid, and so we would use the label (or ) instead of .    Write a draft of how your (de)construction shows that the area of any trapezoid must be where is the length of the summit, is the length of the base, and is the height. You may be asked to write this explanation more formally outside of class.         Thoughts on Area  Adding the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we now have four area formulas in our tool box. One could continue to add more: kites, pentagons, hexagons, etc., but the list would become unwieldly and unhelpful. trapezoid area  area of a trapezoid Instead, we will simply break other polygonal shapes into triangles, parallelograms, and other shapes so that we can compute the area of these and add (or subtract) the areas as appropriate. Measuring tools could be used to estimate the dimensions needed to compute the area of physical spaces such as floorspace or a garden.   Estimating the Area of Curved Regions  As our shapes become more irregular or curved, we apply the definition of area together with estimation. For these situations, we may superimpose the region over a grid of -unit squares. Of course, the boundary of the region may cross through some squares as shown below.   A curved region on a grid of 1x1-unit squares   a curved shape over a grid of squares      Estimating Area of a Curved Region   Give a rough estimate of the area of the region sketched in . Briefly describe what you did.   There are many, many right answers for this task!    Count the squares that are completely inside the sketched region. This will give an underestimate of the area.    Give an overestimate of the area by selecting and counting a collection of squares that completely encloses the sketched region.    Carefully add a horizontal line halfway between each pair of horizontal lines on the original grid. Similarly add vertical line between each existing pair of vertical lines. This will produce a more refined grid with smaller squares.   Each square on the original grid had an area of 1 unit. What is the area of each new square that you created?    Count the small squares that are entirely inside the region and use this to compute an underestimate of the region.   You may choose to use a mix of original and smaller squares as long as they do not overlap.     Give a more refined overestimate of the area of the region by identifying a collection of squares that encloses the region.       Briefly describe how this method can be used to measure the area of any region to a desired level of precision. What are some limitations to this method?      The Area of a Circle  Although a circle is not a polygon, we include the formula for its area here. In fact, Archimedes (287-212 BC) determined the area of a circle by looking at inscribed and circumscribed polygons. As the number of sides grew, the area of the polygons would approach the area of the circle, with the area of the inscribed polygons giving a lower estimate and the area of the circumscribed polygons giving an overestimate. The number was not known at the time, but this method provides a means of calculating to any level of precision.   Inscribing and circumscribing a circle with squares, octagons, and 16-gons.   Three pictures of the same circle. The first has a square inside with vertices touching the circle and a square outside with the sides' midpoints touching the circle. The second circle has an octagon with vertices on the circle and a larger octagon with its sides' midpoints touching the circle. The final picture has a pair of 16-gons that are almost indistinguishable from the circle between them.       "

  "title": "Angle Measure",
  "body": " Angle Measure   How Can We Measure Angles  Having looked at area as the measure of the interior space of a polygon, we now turn our attention to measuring angles. What is an angle and how do we measure it? To fully grasp the definition of angle, we need to first understand the notion of ray.   ray    Ray  consists of point , point , and all points on line which are on the same side of as point . A ray extends infinitely in one direction, has a single endpoint, and cannot be measured.     angle  vertex angle  angle vertex  angle side  side angle   An angle is the union of two rays with a common endpoint. In particular, consists of all points that lie on the rays and . The common endpoint of the rays is called the vertex of the angle and the two rays and are called the sides of the angle.    To think of the measure of an angle as the space between the rays is vague and misleading. The area between the rays is infinite. Note also that the points and on the sides of do not play a role in defining or measuring the angle. If is any other point on ray other than , then is the same angle as and hence have the same measure. Thus it would make no sense to use the linear distance between and for measuring . The sides of an angle are infinite and beyond what can be drawn.  Instead, we think of angle measurement in terms of rotational movement around the vertex, specifically the amount of rotation needed to move one side of the angle on top of the other.   To begin our study of angle measure, we will adopt the practice of assuming that there are 360 degrees in a full rotation about any point. The choice of 360 can be traced back to the Babylonians who were studying planetory paths around 400 B.C. and used a base 60 (instead of base 10) number system. One advantage of the number 360 is that it has a lot of factors, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.    Full rotation about point .   A circle centered around point A. An arrow has been added to the circle to indicate rotation in a counterclockwise direction.        180-degree rotation about point   Line containing C A and B from left to right. Semicircular arc drawn with center A from point B to the line on the opposite side of A.    Suppose point lies between points and on line . In this case, we say that rays and are opposite rays opposite rays  rays opposite . Since , a rotation of 180 degrees will take the ray to the ray on the opposite side of .    Continuing, we define the measurement of angles according to what fraction of a full (or half) rotation they represent. Notice how the protractor divides the semicircular arc into 180 segments, eighteen of which are labeled with numerical values. These are multiples of ten, representing of the half-rotation 180 degrees. To find the measure of , we place the center dot of the protractor over the vertex of the angle and lined up ray with the mark for 0 degrees. The other side of the angle passes through the mark for 40 degrees.   Using a protractor to measure angles.   A protractor aligned with line containing C A B, centered at point A. Labels for every multiple of 10 degrees from zero degrees up through 180 degrees are shown, both clockwise and counterclockwise. Ray AD passes through the indicator for 40 degrees.      Reading a Protractor  Use the picture above to determine the following:   The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .        What fraction of a full rotation is 40 degrees?    What fraction of a full rotation is 110 degrees?     Use a physical protractor and a ruler to draw an angle with measure 78 degrees. Describe your technique.  It is possible to have angle measures greater than 180 degrees. Use words and\/or pictures to describe an angle that measures 240 degrees.   We give a more concise definition of angle measure and introduce the notion of angle congruence.   angle measure  measure angle    angle measure    The measure of , written , is the number of degrees of rotation about vertex needed to move ray onto .     congruent angles    congruent angles    If two angles and have the same measure, we say that the angles are congruent and write . Thus, means .     Note the use of the equals sign in where the two sides of the equation represent numbers. The symbol relates geometrical objects of the same type.     Angles of a Triangle    The GeoGebra app, Angles of a Triangle is useful in completing this activity. You may also perform this activity by carefully cutting out a scalene triangle and tracing it on a sheet of paper.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for Triangle Sum Exploration.      Rotate triangle 180 degrees about the midpoint of side (see hint). Both the original triangle and the rotated version should be visible. What do you notice?  Note that two of the points are double labeled, once for each triangle. If you rightclick on the label, you can move it to make the original label visible.   To perform this rotation in the GeoGebra app, click on the angle rotation icon in the toolbar. Next, click on the interior of the triangle to select the object to be rotated, then click on midpoint to identify the center of the rotation. When prompted to input the angle measure, replace 45 with 180. Then click OK.    Also rotate 180 degrees about the midpoint of side .   Which angle of is congruent to ?    Which angle of is congruent to ?       What does this tell you about ? Explain how the picture shows this.    Make a claim about the sum of the interior angles of a triangle.  Does your work for all triangles or just the one in the picture? To test this in the GeoGebra applet, select the arrow in the tool menu. Then click and drag one of the vertices in the original triangle to change the shape. Do your claims still hold?   Geogebra makes exploring multiple possibilities easier. If you are doing this activity with paper triangles, experiment with other triangles, repeating the previous tasks. If your classmates used different triangles, this would be a good time to compare results.       Additivity of Angles and Definitions Associated with Angles  In this section, you have likely been assuming the additivity of angle measure. Like the additivity of area and length , this is intuitively obvious and will prove useful. We state this as a principle and add it to our toolbox. First, we must clarify what we mean by the interior of an angle.   interior angle  angle interior   A point is said to be in the interior of if lies between points and on line segment .     Additivity of Angle Measure   If ray lies in the interior of angle , then .         Vertical Angles  To conclude this section, we will use what we have learned to make a claim about vertical angles.   angle vertical  vertical angle   When a pair of lines intersect, each pair of opposite angles formed by the intersection are said to be a pair of vertical angles . Vertical angles share a common vertex, namely the point of intersection, and the sides of one angle will be the opposite rays of the sides of the other angle.      Determine two pairs of vertical angles in the figure to the right.   Lines intersecting to form vertical angles   Two lines meet at point E. One line contains points A, E, and B in order and the other contains points C, E, and D in that order.      Each pair of vertical angles consists of two angles.   One pair consists of and . The other pair of vertical angles are and .    What must be true about the measures of any pair of vertical angles? Give a thorough explanation of why this must be true using Principle .     Exercises   Skills Practice   Use a protractor to measure the angles. You may need to print this picture to make accurate measurements. ADD PICTURE AND PROBLEMS.    Determine the missing angles. ADD PICTURE AND PROBLEMS.     Exploring the Concepts   Must the right angle be the largest angle of a right triangle? Explain how this follows from results of this section.    Sketch a few convex quadrilaterals on paper or using the GeoGebra drawing tool.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for Quadrilateral Angle Sum Exercise.    Connect a pair of opposite vertices with a line segment, called a diagonal , to divide the quadrilateral into two shapes.   What two shapes did this create?    What does this tell you about the angle sum of a convex quadrilateral? Explain in words and pictures why this will be true for all convex quadrilaterals.    Experiment with other triangles or by moving vertex A in the applet. What happens to the angle measure when the quadrilateral is no longer convex?      Different interpretations of angles in a concave quadrilateral can be made here. In your explanation, you may need to specific whether you are looking only at interior angles or only considering angles less than 180 degrees.     "

  "body": " What does Parallel Mean?   What does it mean for two lines to be parallel? Remembering that lines continue indefinitely, we defined two lines in the same plane to be  parallel if they never intersect. In this section, we will look more closely at this definition, explore properties related to parallel lines, and explore what lines look like in other geometries.    Geometry on Another Surface  In school, we typically consider lines to lie on a flat surface called a plane. While most of this textbook will follow this tradition, we take a brief departure from planar geometry in this section. The world we live on is not flat; it is roughly spherical. What objects might act like lines on the surface of a sphere. Do spherical lines have the same properties as lines on a plane? One could also study the behavior of lines in our universe: Are they straight or do the bend? What can we say about parallel lines in these environments? Do our familiar properties hold?   Defining Lines on a Sphere   For this activity and the one that follows, you will need a sphere, some rubber bands large enough to go around your sphere, a protractor, a marker, and a piece of thread. Possible spheres include styrophone balls, oranges, rubber softballs, or spheres sold by math education supply companies. Aim for a sphere around the size of a softball or larger. As an alternative, you may use a globe with latitude and longitude lines marked. This latter option requires some string or ribbon instead of rubber bands and markers.    In your own words, write three different endings to the statement, A line is ... . Compare your responses to that of your classmates.    Complete the following sentences:   The sum of the measures of the interior angles of any triangle is ...    Two lines in the plane are parallel if ...       We don’t live on a plane; we live on a sphere. Let’s predict what the lines on a sphere, on our earth, might be. The lines will lie on the surface of the sphere. The lines will not pass through the sphere nor will they project out into space. What are some examples of things that might pose as “lines” on a sphere? Which of your descriptions in do they satisfy?    You’ve probably heard the expression, The shortest distance between two points lies along a line. We shall use this property of line segment to determine which linear features on a sphere act as lines and line segments. Suppose you’re planning to fly from Chicago, Illinois (41.8781N, 87.6298W), to Rome, Italy (41.9028N,12.4964E). There are many paths you could take, many of which might qualify as lines under your suggestions above. Which of these gives the shortest distance from Chicago to Rome? If a globe is available, find Chicago and Rome and experiment with a string to find the path of least distance. If you do not have a globe, mark the approximate locations of Chicago and Rome on your sphere; each should be midway between the equator and the north pole, with Rome approximately a quarter of the way around east of Chicago. Tighten the string connecting these two cities to observe the path of shortest distance between them.   Describe this line segment. Does it follow a latitude line? Bend toward the north pole? Bend toward the equator?    Allow the “line” to extend “forever” beyond the two points. What figure does it form? How is this figure related to the sphere itself?      The geogebra app www.geogebra.org\/m\/j4yqa9jd , authored by Heather Pierce, may also be used to draw lines on a virtual sphere.     The lines on a sphere are simply the great circles of the spheres. A great circle is a circle on a sphere that has the same diameter as the sphere itself. If you were to cut a sphere along a great circle, you would split the circle into two hemispheres of the same size. Restrict yourself to this definition of line for the next exploration.   Properties of Spherical Lines and Triangles    Which latitudes will be lines (great circles) on a sphere?    Which longitudes will be lines on a sphere according to this definition?    Choose any point not on the equator. Can you construct a line through this point that is parallel to the equator? Explain.    What do you expect to be true about the sum of the interior triangles of your spherical triangle? Plot three noncollinear points on your sphere and connect them with spherical line segments (rubber bands).    To measure the angles on a sphere, pass a piece of thread through the vertex hole of a protractor and tie it securely. Hold the protractor with that hole at the vertex of the angle you wish to measure, aligning the baseline of the protractor with one side of the angle. By pulling the thread tight and visually aligning it with the second side of the angle, you should be able to read the measure on the protractor. Record the measurements of each of the three angles of your triangle and then add the three measures.   Angle A:    Angle B:    Angle C:    Sum:       Repeat the last tasks two more times so that you have found the sum of the measures of the angles for three different triangles. Record your measurements and sums. What do you notice?   You should find that spherical triangles behave differently from triangles in the plane.    What is the largest triangle you can make on the sphere? Describe it and then determine the sum of its interior angles.   You get to define largest here and your definition may differ from that of other classmates. Hence, your results may also differ!    Make a conjecture as to the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a spherical triangle. Test your conjecture with additional triangles.      Understanding Parallel Lines  The two explorations, and led to some observations that might have surprised you. One of the ways in which spherical geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that no lines on the sphere are parallel. Of course, we could have defined line differently, but that would have led to a loss of other properties of lines, such as the existence and uniqueness of a line joining any pair of points. Hence, we need to be clear regarding the geometry we are working with. Except where specified, our study will be limited to Euclidean geometry where lines lie on planes, not spheres. In Euclidean geometry, parallel lines do exist; in fact, for each point and line not passing through that point, we can always draw exactly one line that is parallel to the given line and passes through the given point. We will accept this statement, known as Playfair's Parallel Postulate, as one of our principles.    Playfair's Parallel Postulate   Given a line and a point not on , there is one and only one line passing through and parallel to .    In order to be parallel, two lines must lie in the same plane. If you are reading this indoors, you probably have a wall in front of you and a wall somewhere to your right. The line where the ceiling meets the wall in front of you will never intersect the line formed by the intersection of the floor and the wall to your right. Still, we do not consider these two lines to be parallel because there is no plane containing both lines. Instead, we say that these are skew lines .  Check your Understanding Add picture of rectangular pyramid and ask for examples of skew and parallel lines  We also observed that angle measures in spherical triangles did not behave in the way that Euclidean triangles do. This suggests that the measures of angles may be related to the parallel postulate. Indeed the two concepts are closely connected. In section , we rotated a triangle 180 degrees about a midpoint of one of its sides and again around the midpoint of a second side and noticed that copies of the three angles formed a line when placed side by side at a vertex. We now look at that exploration in the context of parallelism.   Alternate Interior Angles   In the following application, triangle has been rotated 180 degrees about midpoint of side to form . Note that point coincides with and point coincides with .   An interactive Geogebra applet for Exploration on Alternate Interior Angles.       What appears to be true about lines and ?

What can we say about the relationship between angles and    In terms of angle measure? How do you know?   An angle measurement tool is provided in the app if you choose to use it. Click on the three points defining the angle in counterclockwise order with the vertex of the angle being the second of the three. You may be able to give an explanation that does not use actual measurement.     In terms of their relationship to the parallel lines, and and the line ?    In terms of triangle and its copy ?       When a line cuts across two other lines, we call it a transversal of the lines. When a transversal cuts across two parallel lines and so that points and are on opposite sides of , angles and are said to be alternate interior angles . we will not give a proof, the following two statements are equivalent to Playfair's Parallel Postulate:    Given two parallel lines and and a line that crosses and , corresponding angles have the same angle measure.

  "body": " Explorations with Regular Polygons    Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings can be used to tile the plane.   The material in this section has been adapted from Section 4.1 in Symmetry, Shape, and Space .     Regular Polygons  We begin by defining what it means for a polygon to be regular.   regular polygon  polygon regular   A polygon is a regular polygon if all of its sides and all of its angles are congruent.     Check Your Understanding!  Explain why each shape below is not a regular polygon:   Rhombus ABCD with obtuse angles at B and D, Rectangle EFGH with height 6 and width 10, and a House-shaped pentagon with base length 4, wall height 4, and total height 6.      Regular Tilings  In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominos. In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.   tiling  tiling regular  regular tiling  tiling monohedral  monohedral tiling   A tiling is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no gaps and no overlaps. A monohedral tiling is tiling that uses only one shape, a regular tiling is a monohedral tiling using a single regular polygon as its tile. In a regular tiling, each side of a polygon will line up perfectly with a side of an adjacent copy.     Regular Tilings   This activity may be completed using physical tiles or in an app. Be sure to save a record of your designs by tracing, photography, or screenshots. Some of the computations will also be used later in this section. You are encourage to keep an accessible record of your work for future reference.  The web application Polypad by Mathigon provides regular -gons for . These are the top six shapes in the Polygons and Shapes menu. Simply drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area. Rotate using the black dot and move by clicking on the interior. For -gons with , use the hexagon labeled \"regular\" in the bottom rom of shapes. After you have moved this figure into the whiteboard, use the dotted vertex to increase the number of sides. You can then use the duplicated sheet icon on the flip\/cut\/... menu to make copies of your -gon.     Select a single regular polygon, making copies of it as needed, and use it to construct a regular tiling. Construct enough of the tiling to convince others that the tiling can continue to tile the plane with no gaps and overlaps.    Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, regular hexagons, and other regular -gons to determine which can be used to create a regular tiling and which do not. What do you think will happen with regular polygons with more than eight sides? Why?    Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure places a role in determining whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. This task will lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other regular n-gons.    A triangulated regular pentagon   A regular pentagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The interior angle at A has been split by diagonals into angles 1, 2, and 3. Angle D has been split into angles 4 and 5. Angle C has been split into angles 6 and 7.                            , etc.        Explain why     What is ?    Use the fact that the pentagon is divided into triangles to determine .    Having just computed the sum of the five congruent angles of a regular pentagon, determine .    Some of what you found, but not all, will be true for all convex pentagons. What results about angle measure will also hold for non-regular convex pentagons? What will be different?       Use your work from the previous task to complete the row for regular pentagon in the table below. Repeat this procedure for squares, regular hexagons, regular octagons, and regular decagons, drawing diagonals from a single vertex to dissect the polygon into triangles, using the triangles to determine the total vertex angle measure, and then determining the measure of each angle. In the final row, is a variable representing the number of sides and the answers will be algebraic expressions involving the variable .

How many squares can meet at a single point?    How many regular hexagons can meet at a single point?    Explain in words and pictures why these three regular polygons can each produce a regular tiling.    When we tried to surround a point with regular pentagons a gap was formed. What is the degree measure of that gap?    If , do you know whether a regular -gon might produce a regular tiling? Include a discussion of vertex angle measure in your explanation.         Semiregular Tilings  If we allow more than one regular polygon to be used in a tiling, we may are able to create a wider variety of designs.   tiling semiregular  semiregular tiling  tiling monohedral   A semiregular tiling is a tiling consisting of two or more regular polygon with common side lengths with the additional requirement that the arrangement of polygons around each vertex is the same.     In Search of Semiregular Tilings   Once again, you are encouraged to continue the practice of saving your sketches, work, and results as they may be useful later in this section.    What must be true about the measures of the angles of the vertices meeting at and surrounding a single point?   The sum of the angle measures must be 360 degrees.    In , you determined the vertex angle measure for a few regular polygons and developed a general formula for finding this measure. Use the formula, to determine the vertex angle measure of each of the following regular -gons. If the answer is not a whole number, write the answer as a mixed number.   heptagon (7 sides)    nonagon (9 sides)    dodecagon (12 sides)    pentakaidecagon (15 sides)    octakaidecagon (18 sides)    icosagon (20 sides)    tetrakaicosaigon (24 sides)    tetracontakaidigon (42 sides)      The measure of the vertex angle of a regular -gon is given by the formula .

Verify that the sum of the angles meeting at the vertex is 360 degrees.    Extend the design making sure that you always have one or two triangles between any two squares. Will this eventually fill the plane without gaps or overlaps?    Note that gives a different pattern. Show that it is possible to create a tiling using the vertex arrangement by building outward from your initial vertex arrangement.       Verify arithmetically that it is possible for an equilateral triangle, a regular heptagon, and a regular tetracontakaidigon (pictured below), to fit snugly around a vertex with no overlaps. In shorthand, we can write this vertex arrangement as .   A tetracontakaidigon (42-gon).   (for accessibility)      Use the angle measures you found in and to list all combinations of three, four, or five regular polygons that could meet at a vertex, writing the vertex configurations in shorthand notation. Like the example in , the same shape may be repeated. If more than three polygons meet at a vertex, consider the different ways in which they could be arranged.   Note that and are potentially two other ways of writing in . We could begin at any polygon and list the polygons in order. To avoid these repetitions, it is standard practice to begin with the polygon with the smallest number of sides and then to move to its neighbor with the smallest number of sides, continuing around until all the polygons around the point have been named. Similarly, we write rather than for the tiling where the two squares are adjacent.    We are not including the three regular tilings in this list. There is one more vertex arrangement using five polygons (in addition to 3.3.4.3.4 and 3.3.3.4.4), five using four polygons, and eight more using three polygons (in addition to 3.7.42).    Some of the vertex arrangements in the previous task will extend to create a semiregular titling, but not all of them! Experiment by surrounding one vertex using the pattern and then try to surround the neighboring vertices using the same arrangement. Which seem to work and which fail? For the ones that fail, what seems to go wrong?   Only eight of the seventeen possible vertex arrangements can be used to create a semiregular tiling.    What do you notice about the vertex arrangements that work (or those that don't work)? What do you wonder?    This activity may have involved more of a struggle that some of the others. Perhaps you only found about half of the possibilities in or you cannot yet see a pattern to help determine which vertex arrangements lead to a semiregular tiling. That is perfectly normal. Write down the ideas that you do have and share them with classmates. As you share what you have observed and listen to others' discoveries, you and your classmates may uncover some amazing results.    Narrowing Down the Options  When we look at possible vertex arrangements for a semiregular tiling, our options are very limited. Not including the regular tiling by squares, you should have found three groups of four regular polygons with an angle sum of 360 degrees. All of these have at least one polygon appearing twice. Why do some of these extend to a semiregular tiling while others do not? Does it matter whether the common polygons are next to each other or separated?  As we attempt to create a 3.3.6.6 pattern, we find that it is impossible to maintain a consistent vertex arrangement. Fairly quickly, we are forced to create a 3.6.3.6 arrangement at some vertices. On the other hand, a 3.3.6.6 vertex arrangement can continue indefinitely. Let us explore why this happens.   Semiregular Tilings with Four Regular Polygons at a Vertex   Use physical or virtual triangles and hexagons to sketch the vertex arrangement 3.3.6.6 or refer to an earlier sketch if available.    Choose one of the two triangles at this vertex and attempt to surround it with triangles and\/or hexagons while adhering to the 3.3.6.6 arrangement.    Note that each triangle in a 3.3.6.6 must share a side with one triangle and one hexagon due to the order of the 3's and 6's.    Surrounding a regular triangle with regular triangles and regular hexagons.    Will the remaining side abut a triangle or a hexagon? Discuss what happens in each case.       There is a second group of four regular polygons consisting of two equilateral triangles and two other polygons.   What are the other two polygons? We will represent the number of sides of these polygons by and .    Explain why the arrangement will not extend to a semiregular tiling using an argument similar to what we did with .    Explain why the arrangement also fails to create a semiregular tiling.       The remaining semiregular tiling with four polygons meeting at each vertex has two squares and two other polygons in the vertex arrangement.   What are the other two polygons? Again, the number of sides of these two polygons are represented by and in the questions that follow.    Are you able to surround a square along its sides by an alternating sequence of -gons and -gons?    One of the polygons has an odd number, , of sides. Are you able to surround the -gon along its sides by an alternating sequence of squares and -gons?    Explain in words and pictures why extends to a semiregular tiling, but does not. Draw a sketch of if you do not already have one.       We conclude that there are only two semiregular tilings and one regular tiling of the plane where four polygons meet at a vertex. All three vertex arrangements with five polygons meeting extend to semiregular tilings. To complete this analysis, we consider which three-polygon vertex arrangements extend to a semiregular tiling.   Semiregular Tilings with Three Regular Polygons at a Vertex   Not including the regular tiling , there are nine possible vertex arrangements consisting of three regular polygons. List as many as you can, referring back to the work you did in .    Verify algebraically that can surround a single point.    Use the fact that 5 is an odd number to explain why does not extend to a semiregular tiling. You may include pictures as well as words in your explanation.    Determine the three vertex arrangements with three polygons that extend to a semiregular tiling. Why must the others be eliminated?      Summary and Tools  As we conclude this long section, it is wise to reflect on what we have learned. What should we add to our tool box for later use? Definitions for regular polygons, tilings, regular tilings, and semiregular tilings were introduced at the beginning of the section. You should also note the items below:  Key Ideas related to Regular Polygons    What formula can be used to compute the angle measure for a regular -gon?    What is the sum of the measures of the vertex angles for any (not-necessarily regular) convex -gon? For example, the measures of the angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees. What is the total for a convex quadrilateral, a convex pentagon, etc.?    Describe the three regular tilings.    If a group of polygons meet at a single vertex, what must be the sum of the angle measures at that vertex? Note that this wording generalizes this fact to nonregular polygons as well.    Just because a collection of regular polygons can surround a vertex does not mean that they can create a semiregular tiling. Give an example of a vertex arrangement that does not extend to a regular tiling. Support your claim.      "

Upon completing this section, you should be able to explain to others how the Pythagorean Theorem follows from our basic principles. First, we introduce some terminology and refresh our memory on how to apply the theorem.    Right Triangles   triangle right  right triangle  hypotenuse  leg right triangle   As noted in , a right triangle is a triangle with one right angle. The longest side, called the hypotenuse , of a right triangle is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides of the right triangle are called the legs .     Check Your Understanding   Refer to the picture as you answer the following:  (for accessibility)      Which lower case letter represents the hypotenuse in the triangle above?        Which angle appears to be the smallest in the triangle?        Which side appears to be the shortest in the triangle?      How are the answers to the last two questions related? Does this relationship also hold for the largest side and largest angle?   The smallest side is opposite the smallest angle. The largest side is opposite the largest angle.      The Pythagorean Theorem  The Pythagorean Theorem states that if and are the lengths of the sides of a right triangle and is the length of the hypotenuse, then . The next set of questions will refresh your skill in using the Pythagorean Theorem to determine missing lengths.   Check your Understanding   A triangle has legs of length 5 and 7. Determine the length of the hypotenuse.        A square has a diagonal of length . Determine the length of the sides.   Since the sides of a square are the same length, use the same letter to represent all of them. How do you create a triangle from a square?          Proving the Pythagorean Theorem with Picture Puzzles  The Pythagorean Theorem is very useful, but it is also somewhat mysterious. Why does the formula work for all right triangles? Surprisingly, there are more than 350 recognized proofs of the Pythagorean. We will look at just a few. In the following exploration, you will rearrange polygons built from a right triangle, and use the rearrangements to explain why in each case. You are encouraged to try all the proofs and to choose one to learn well enough to convince others.   The book, The Pythagorean Proposition, by Elisha S. Loomis, (NCTM:1968) contains 367 proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem.     Puzzling over Why the Pythagorean Theorem Holds   For these explorations, we start with an arbitrary right triangle with hypotenuse length and legs of length and .   First Pythagorean Puzzle  The four triangles on the right are congruent copies of and the square in the upper right has side length .   Right triangle ABC and four congruent copies, a square of side length c, and a larger square that can be filled by four copies of the triangle and the smaller square.    An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.       Fill the square on the lower left using the four copies of the triangle and the square on the right. Pieces can be moved by selecting the interior and rotated by moving the visible point. Triangle is only shown for reference and will not be used. As always, there should be no gaps nor overlaps. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas still using variables.      Second Pythagorean Puzzle  The four triangles on the right are congruent copies of and the square in the upper right has side length , the length of the shorter leg of the right triangle. The square below it has a side length corresponding to the other leg.   Four congruent right triangles, two squares with side lengths, a and b, corresponding to the legs of the right triangle, and a larger square frame.    An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.       Fill the square frame on the lower left with the four congruent right triangles and the squares with lengths and , respectively. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas using variables.      Using the First Two Puzzles Together to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem  Look at the two ways in which you filled the square frames and the expressions for the area of the frames. How can you use this to justify the formula ?   An alternative is to use just the first puzzle and more algebra to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. This is acceptable, but Education majors may appreciate that the method of using both puzzles together can be used to convince third graders.    Are the square frames the same size? Why does this allow us to set the two sums of areas equal to each other?   A Presidential Proof  This proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is attributed to James A. Garfield, the twentieth President of the United States. Refer to the diagram below:   Right triangle ABC with right angle at C. Point D is placed on ray CA so that the length of AD equals the length of BC. Point E is placed on the same side of CD as B so that line DE is perpendicular to AD and segment DE is the same length as AC. Points E and B are joined by a segment. This creates two congruent right triangles ABC and EAD and an isoceles right triangle BAE. The outer boundary is a trapezoid BCDE since BC and DE are parallel.      The diagram above consists of two congruent right triangles and one isosceles right triangle arranged to form a trapezoid. Label the hypotenuses with the letter . Label the smallest side of these triangles and the other leg . Note that the hypotenuse of the remaining right triangle is longer than . Instead, call it .    Identify the two parallel bases for the trapezoid. Determine the height of this trapezoid in terms of the labels you put on the diagram.    Compute the area of the trapezoid using the trapezoid formula leaving your answer in terms of the variables you used to label the diagram.    Similarly, compute the areas of each of the three triangular pieces and add them together.    How does this prove the Pythagorean Theorem?       The final proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is primarily visual. Almost no algebra is required.   An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.      Rearrange the four congruent triangle copies and the small square to form a square. Verify that your shape is definitely a square. Do not use . Drag the centers of shapes to move them and use the labeled corners to rotate. Save a copy of your work.    What is the length of a side of this square?    What is the area of the square you created?    What is the length of a side of the small square in terms of the labels , , and ?    Once again, our goal is to show . Use the same five pieces to create a pair of touching squares of area and . Some puzzle pieces will cover parts of both squares. A second copy of the Geogebra applet is provided below for your use.   An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem, repeated from above.      Does the small square have the same dimensions as before? How do you know?    How do these two sketches together show that the Pythagorean Theorem holds?        Reflecting on the Pythagorean Theorem  Most people can state the Pythagorean Theorem and use it to find missing lengths in a right triangle, but in this section you have learned why the theorem holds for all right triangles. We have practiced using variables in our arguments so that our explanation is not just shown for a right triangle with lengths 3, 4, and 5 (or 5, 12, and 13), but for all right triangles. Even so, the fact that we used puzzle pieces enables us to share this knowledge with anyone who has at least a fourth grade knowledge of geometry, area, and square numbers. A few of our proofs did not require the algebraic representation and symbolic manipulation learned in middle or high school.  On the other hand, we need to be careful that we do not try to apply this theorem to non-right triangles. It is possible to create a triangle whose side lengths are 3, 5, and 6, but this triangle will not have a right angle. In fact, the converse of the Pythagorean theorem states that if , , and are sides of a triangle with , then the triangle will have a right angle opposite the side with length . We will not prove this converse OR DO I PUT IT AS AN EXERCISE.    "

  "body": " Puzzling over Why the Pythagorean Theorem Holds   For these explorations, we start with an arbitrary right triangle with hypotenuse length and legs of length and .   First Pythagorean Puzzle  The four triangles on the right are congruent copies of and the square in the upper right has side length .   Right triangle ABC and four congruent copies, a square of side length c, and a larger square that can be filled by four copies of the triangle and the smaller square.    An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.       Fill the square on the lower left using the four copies of the triangle and the square on the right. Pieces can be moved by selecting the interior and rotated by moving the visible point. Triangle is only shown for reference and will not be used. As always, there should be no gaps nor overlaps. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas still using variables.      Second Pythagorean Puzzle  The four triangles on the right are congruent copies of and the square in the upper right has side length , the length of the shorter leg of the right triangle. The square below it has a side length corresponding to the other leg.   Four congruent right triangles, two squares with side lengths, a and b, corresponding to the legs of the right triangle, and a larger square frame.    An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.       Fill the square frame on the lower left with the four congruent right triangles and the squares with lengths and , respectively. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas using variables.      Using the First Two Puzzles Together to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem  Look at the two ways in which you filled the square frames and the expressions for the area of the frames. How can you use this to justify the formula ?   An alternative is to use just the first puzzle and more algebra to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. This is acceptable, but Education majors may appreciate that the method of using both puzzles together can be used to convince third graders.    Are the square frames the same size? Why does this allow us to set the two sums of areas equal to each other?   A Presidential Proof  This proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is attributed to James A. Garfield, the twentieth President of the United States. Refer to the diagram below:   Right triangle ABC with right angle at C. Point D is placed on ray CA so that the length of AD equals the length of BC. Point E is placed on the same side of CD as B so that line DE is perpendicular to AD and segment DE is the same length as AC. Points E and B are joined by a segment. This creates two congruent right triangles ABC and EAD and an isoceles right triangle BAE. The outer boundary is a trapezoid BCDE since BC and DE are parallel.      The diagram above consists of two congruent right triangles and one isosceles right triangle arranged to form a trapezoid. Label the hypotenuses with the letter . Label the smallest side of these triangles and the other leg . Note that the hypotenuse of the remaining right triangle is longer than . Instead, call it .    Identify the two parallel bases for the trapezoid. Determine the height of this trapezoid in terms of the labels you put on the diagram.    Compute the area of the trapezoid using the trapezoid formula leaving your answer in terms of the variables you used to label the diagram.    Similarly, compute the areas of each of the three triangular pieces and add them together.    How does this prove the Pythagorean Theorem?       The final proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is primarily visual. Almost no algebra is required.   An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem.      Rearrange the four congruent triangle copies and the small square to form a square. Verify that your shape is definitely a square. Do not use . Drag the centers of shapes to move them and use the labeled corners to rotate. Save a copy of your work.    What is the length of a side of this square?    What is the area of the square you created?    What is the length of a side of the small square in terms of the labels , , and ?    Once again, our goal is to show . Use the same five pieces to create a pair of touching squares of area and . Some puzzle pieces will cover parts of both squares. A second copy of the Geogebra applet is provided below for your use.   An interactive Geogebra applet for proving the Pythagorean Theorem, repeated from above.      Does the small square have the same dimensions as before? How do you know?    How do these two sketches together show that the Pythagorean Theorem holds?     "
