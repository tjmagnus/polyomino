  "title": "Invitation to Explore",
  "body": " Invitation to Explore   To The Student  This class may be different from many of the mathematics classes you have taken in the past. You will be encouraged to explore geometrical ideas, solve puzzles, make conjectures, discuss with classmates, make connections between ideas, explain your solutions, and justify your reasoning. You should not expect to be shown how to solve problems by the instructions. In fact, there may not be one single right way to complete some of the problems but rather many acceptable ways of coming to a solution. Your teacher will encourage you to share these alternative approaches with the class.  Perhaps this course would be easier for you if you were simply told how to solve the problems, but the objective of this course is not to learn facts and methods, but rather to develop your mathematical thinking and communication skills. In this age of technology, computers can do many of the algorithms and processes that were at one time the core of mathematics education. However, they have not replaced man’s role of developing strategies to solve problems and recognizing when mathematics can be applied to real-world situations. Developing these reasoning skills will help you more in your future than simply being able to quote the Theorem. On the other hand, it is still useful to know the Pythagorean Theorem so that you are able to recognize when it can (and cannot) be used to solve both elementary and complex problems. This theorem along with some other basic formulas you have learned in the past (and can look up online) form a toolbox for our work, but we will give more emphasis to the creative process that is mathematics.  In A Mathematician’s Lament, Paul Lockhart describes a nightmare in which music was taught in the same way that mathematics is currently taught. He says,   Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful beauty; to be alive.  If we were to teach music via lecture and mere recall, focusing on the notation and structure, but not allowing students to experience and create music, the subject would be dry and uninteresting, the creative process would be stifled, and very few would have an interest in learning music. Yet, that is what we have done with much of our mathematics instruction. We have removed both the exploration and the fun.    So I encourage you to embrace the experience that is mathematics. Approach each puzzle with an open mind, make guesses as to what is happening, and experiment to determine whether your ideas are correct. Play with the materials and the concepts and ask new questions. In this course, you might even be invited to explore a question you posed instead of the one the teacher originally posed! Mathematics is not just about finding the answer; even when there is an answer, our work should evoke new questions: Why? What else?    First Exploration   Tiling Rectangles with Polyominoes   Although this task is to fill a box, you are encouraged to think outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect as you respond to the \"why\" questions and sharing your ideas with your classmates will also contribute greatly to your learning. Have fun!    Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a tetromino  tetromino  polyomino  tetromino is a flat figure created by joining four congruent squares along edges. Fill the blue square with non-overlapping copies of the green L-shaped tetronimo. How many tetrominoes are required?  To use the interactive tool, click and drag the L-shape to create a new copy of the shape. Use the large dot, to rotate the copy. Arrange copies to cover the blue square. This may also be done on paper.     Interactive tool on Polypad by Mathigon      Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes: an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape, and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain why you believe the tiling is impossible.  Once again in the application, copies of the I-shape, Z-shape, T-shape, and small square can be created by clicking the shape and dragging. Four larger squares are provided; try to tile one with the I-shape, one with the Z-shape, etc.      Interactive tool on Polypad by Amplify.     Since a tetromino is formed by joining four unit squares, each tetromino has an area of four square units, as illustrated here.   The L-tetromino drawn as a joining of four square tiles.   What is the area of the square that you filled with tetrominoes?    Similarly, we define a pentomino  pentomino  polyomino pentomino to be a figure formed by joining five congruent squares along edges. One pentomino is pictured. Create new pentominoes by copying and moving the provided purple unit square. Note that if two pentominoes are reflections or rotations of each other, we consider them to be the same pentomino. Be sure to save a copy of your sketch for future reference.    Interactive tool on Polypad by Amplify     There are twelve different pentominoes. Did you find them all?   The pentominoes may be labeled as F, I, L, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, y, and Z. Can you figure out which is which?    Use some of the pentominoes you created to build solid rectangles. The hint below gives access to an interactive tool.   What dimensions are possible? Does it matter whether you restrict yourself to never using a pentomino more than once in a rectangle?    Can you build a rectangle that uses every pentomino exactly once?      Use the interactive Polypad activity below or access a fullscreen version at Polypad by Amplify using the link Pentomino Set .     Are there any rectangles that cannot be filled using only pentominoes? Why?    As you participated in this exploration, what did you wonder? What did you notice about area?   There is no right or wrong answer here! Write something!     More Explorations with Pentominoes   To simplify our discussion, we can call each pentomino by the letter it most resembles, namely F, I, L, P, T, U, V, W, X, y, Z, and N. The F and N pentominos are less obvious and are identified below. Sketch and identify the others or refer to and label your earlier sketches.   The F-pentomino is three squares tall with an extra square attached to the middle of these three on one side and an extra square attached to the top square on the other side. The N-pentomino has a column of three squares and a column of two squares. Slide one of the columns so that the two columns only share a single side of a square and the total height is four units.     Observe how a larger copy of the L-pentomino tile can be created by filling it with four different pentominoes:   The basic L-pentomino next to a L-shaped pentomino built from basic L-, I-, F-, and P-pentominoes.      How are the height and width of the new larger L-tile related to the height and width of the basic L-tile?    How is the area of the new larger L-tile related to the area of the basic L-tile?    Choose another pentomino from among F, I, P, T, U, W, y, and Z, and demonstrate how it can be created using four distinct polyominoes. Note that this cannot be done with X or V.      Use the interactive Polypad activity below or access a fullscreen version at Polypad by Amplify using the link Pentomino Set .     On the other hand, it is possible to create a copy of the V tile that is three times the height and width of the basic V tile by filling it with nine distinct pentominoes.   Show how this can be done.    How does the new area compare with the original?    Explore whether other pentominoes can be tripled in this way.       What happens to the area of a figure when its height and width of are doubled? tripled? How does the number of basic pentominoes needed to fill the figure change?      Learning from the Explorations  The purpose of is two-fold. It introduces the exploratory nature of the course and it also suggests a few important geometric facts and definitions that we will use as our initial geometrical foundation. These facts are chosen because they are intuitively obvious, but they give us some building blocks we will need to justify more complex ideas. We state them here for clarity and future reference beginning with a definition for area.   area   The area of a closed figure in the plane is the number of unit squares needed to fill the figure without any gaps or overlaps.    We noted that each tetromino was made up of four unit squares and each pentomino consisted of five unit squares; thus the area of a tetromino is four square units and the area of a pentomino is five square units. We also recalled the area formula for a rectangle.   Area of a Rectangle   The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width; in symbols, .    Another observation is that if you can fill a closed region with smaller shapes so that none of the smaller shapes overlap and no part of the region is left uncovered, then the area of the region is equal to the sum of the areas of the smaller shapes. While this may seem like a simple idea, we will see that it allows us to determine the area formulas of other geometric shapes and to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. We can dissect dissect a shape into smaller shapes, rearrange the pieces into another shape, and argue that the two regions have equal area because they both consist of the same collection of smaller shapes.   Additivity of Area   If a region can be cut into non-overlapping sections, the area of the whole region is equal to the sum of the areas of the sections.    We applied these two principles in where we attempted to construct rectangles using pentominoes. Since pentominoes have an area of five square units, we could only construct rectangles with areas divisible by 5, namely 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60. To construct a rectangle of area 10, the same pentomino must be used twice. In the same way, any shape made up entirely of tetrominoes must have an area divisible by 4.  Finally, we observed that when the lengths of all sides of a two-dimensional figure are doubled (or tripled), the area of the figure is multiplied by 4 (or 9). This is easy to observe in a rectangle with length and width . When we create a new rectangle with length and width , the resulting area is square units.  Check Your Understanding  Demonstrate algebraically why the area of a two-dimensional figure is multiplied by 9 when then lengths of the sides are tripled.   Use the example for getting four times the area by doubling the lengths as a guide.   When and , the area is      Exploring to Learn  Hopefully as you worked through these tasks, you allowed yourself to experiment with different arrangements of squares and polyominoes. This openness to creative exploration is essential to mathematical thinking. Phrases like \"what if\" or \"I wonder\" arise often as mathematicians create and make sense of new ideas. If you find yourself wanting to explore a question arising from a task but not explicitly asked, jot down your question and share it with your instructor. Your instructor might encourage you to investigate your question or even invite your classmates to consider it. Some questions may be addressed in a later section, too tangential, beyond the scope of this course, or even unsolved by the mathematical community. Thus your instructor will make the decision on which questions to pursue and when.   You may have noticed that you and your peers discovered different ways of completing the same task. Multiple approaches and multiple solutions are often welcome and even encouraged! If you have a strategy that is different than your group members, try both separately and then compare. You have the ability to do the mathematics, but it will be more meaningful if you attack tasks in a way that makes sense to you. This will require you and your peers to take some risks, to challenge each other to speak up, and to be nonjudgmental of others.  In fact, doing mathematics is a social activity. When we notice patterns and make conjectures, we share our ideas with others and use logic to make convincing arguments. For over 2500 years, mathematicians have been adding to the body of mathematical knowledge; some of which has been shared with you during your studies. The field of mathematics continues to grow.  Unfortunately, most students have had little opportunity to creatively explore in their mathematics classes. You have probably memorized formulas and performed calculations in many of your mathematics classes. While formulas and calculations are useful tools in mathematics, they are not the essence of mathematics and can often be done via a computer. In this course, we will develop the creative thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving practices that set humans apart from computers and are valued by employers. We will think outside the box, make predictions, and wonder why. Different approaches and strategies are encouraged. Relax and have fun exploring mathematics!     Exercises   Building Our Toolbox   Throughout the course, you will learn important principles, definitions, formulas, and geometry facts. Create your toolbox so that these tools will be easy to find and meaningful to you when you need to refer to them or review material. Gathering your tools in one section of your notebook would be ideal.    In your own words and illustration(s), describe why the definition of area leads to the formula for the area of a rectangle at least in the case where the length and width are whole numbers.    What is meant by Additivity of Area ? Give an example and describe in your own words.     Skills and Recall   Exercises in this section are designed to check that you have understood the main ideas and that you can perform the skills, techniques, and formulas needed to move on in the course. Exercises in this group may also encourage practice of skills that appear in education licensure exams.    Determine the area of each shape in .   Shapes for   Shape 1 is a cross formed by two equal length intersecting bars. Each bar is 2 inches by 8 inches so that their intersection is a 2 by 2 square. Shape 2 is more irregular, close to a rotated L-shape with a 1 by 1 square removed near where the legs meet. One leg of the L is 8 inches long and 2 inches wide. The other is 7 inches long and 3 inches wide.     Break each figure into shapes for which the area can be computed. Then use to find the total area of the region.    Refer to as you answer the following:   Find the area of rectangle with height 14 cm. and width 6 cm. Then use your answer to find the area of right triangle .    is used in each of these problems.

The width of the rectangle is 10 cm.     A triomino consists of three squares joined at edges. How many distinct triominoes exist? Sketch them. Do not include any triominoes that are reflections or rotations of ones you have already sketched.   There are just two.   One is I-shaped; the other L-shaped.    A hexomino is constructed from six squares. Explain why it is impossible to construct a solid rectangle with area twenty using non-overlapping hexomino tiles.   What is the area of each hexomino? How does that affect the total area?    Jay constructs a solid rectangle using heptomino (seven-square) tiles. What must be true about the area of Jay's rectangle?   We do not know how many heptominoes Jay used, but we do know the area of each heptomino. Many rectangles could be built, but their areas will always have what factor?       Show that it is possible to construct a rectangle of area 10 using pentominoes if you are allowed to reuse the same tile.    Show that if you are allowed to use copies of the same pentomino tile multiple times you can construct a rectangle of area for every whole number .      Use the same tetromino times. What tetromino is already a rectangle?    Sketch all the different rectangles with no gaps or overlaps that can be created by a single set of five tetrominoes. You don't have to use all of the tetrominoes in each rectangles and you may use a new set of tetrominoes for each rectangle; however no rectangle will use a single tile more than once.   The Area Model for Multiplication  This problem illustrates the Area Model for Multiplication, an effective way of helping elementary school students visualize the operation of multiplication. area model for multiplication    On graph paper sketch a rectangle. Show the fifteen squares that make up the area.    Note that 12 can be factored as , , or . Sketch area models for each of these products.        Extending the Concepts   Area Model for Two-digit Numbers  Multiplication of two-digit numbers can be represented using the area model: for example, to multiply 47 by 25 we can represent 47 as 4 tens and 7 ones and 25 as 2 tens and 5 ones. We then can sketch the product as shown in .   Determine the area of each of the four subrectangles pictured. Here, the squares on the grid are not but defined by the notations on the sides.   One of the subrectangles is a -rectangle. What are the others?   Add the four areas of the subrectangles together to find the total area.   The standard algorithm to multiply is shown in . Identify what the 235 and 940 in the algorithm represent in the area model pictured at the beginning of this exercise.   Consider sums of areas.   A rectangular model and algorithm for two-digit multiplication    Rectangular Model   A rectangle labeled with sides 40+7 and 20+5 and split into subrectangles 40 by 20, 40 by 5, 7 by 20, and 7 by 5.

Demonstrate how this area model can be used to compute the product.   Use as an example. You will need more subrectangles for this problem.   Modeling the Multiplication of Fractions and Mixed Numbers  Each side of the square, pictured in has a length of 1.   Sketch line segments that divide the height of the square equally into thirds and the width equally into fourths. How many subrectangles does this split the square into? What is the area of each subrectangle? What does this tell you about ?   A unit square   A square     The sketch in shows a model of . Compute the areas of each of the four shaded regions (blue, orange, pink, and green), and then compute the total. Note that solid lines are used to represent lengths of whole units and dashed lines represent fractional lengths    Area Model for   A 3 by 2 rectangle. The side of length 2 is split into one whole unit and five fifths. The side of length 3 is split into two whole units and three thirds. The upper 1\/3 strip and rightmost 1\/5 strip are unshaded. The two 1 by 1 squares are shaded blue. Two one by one-third rectangles are orange. Four one-fifth by one rectangles are pink and there are four green one third by one-fifth rectangles forming a 2\/3 by 2\/5 rectangle.     Draw an area model of by dividing the unit length into fifths and the unit width into fourths. Shade and compute the product. Explain how you find the numerator and denominator of the unsimplified fraction from the sketch.   Begin by drawing a unit square similar to , dividing the sides according to the denominators of the fractions.

An area model for the expression .   A rectangle cut into four subrectangles. The left side is made up of a segment of length 7 plus a segment of length x with a horizontal line cutting the rectangle between these two segments. The bottom edge is composed of a segment of length 5 plus a segment of length 4x. A vertical line cuts the rectangle between these two segments.    Area in Probability   A tetrahedral die is a triangular pyramid with four sides numbered 1 through 4. Because the die is shaped like a triangular pyramid, there is no top face so the number rolled will correspond to the top point if the dice are labeled like the ones to the right. If three tetrahedral die are rolled the possible sums range from 3 to 12. For example, consider the sum 5 which can be achieved by each of the following six rolls: (1,1,3), (1,2,2), (1,3,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (3,1,1).   Tetrahedral dice   Triangular pyramids with sides labeled 1, 2, 3, 4.      Determine all of the ways that a sum of 9 can occur.   The rolls , and count as three separate rolls.   List all of the ways that a sum of 6 can be rolled.   The sketch in is a bar graph or histogram showing the frequency or number of ways that each of the sums from 3 to 12 can be rolled with three tetrahedral dice. Note that the sums are given on the horizontal axis and the frequencies are on the vertical axis. Note how the third vertical bar, centered above the number 5, has height 6 to illustrate the fact that there are six ways of rolling a sum of 5.   What is the total number of possible rolls?   Consider the heights of the columns.   What is the number of rolls resulting in 7?   Consider the bar centered over the number 7.   The probability of an event is computed by dividing the number of different rolls meeting the criteria for that event by the total number of different possible rolls. What is the probability of rolling a 7 with three tetrahedral dice?   Frequency of sums of tetrahedral dice rolls   A symmetric histogram graph is shown. The following rectangular bars appear on the graph, each with width 1 and base on the x-axis. Above the number 3 and above the number 12, sits a rectangle with height 1. Above both 4 and 11, the bar's height is 3. Above both 5 and 10, the height is 6. Above both 6 and 9, the height is 10. And above both 7 and 8, the height is 12.      Writing Prompt  Mathematical Autobiography Write an essay (2 to 4 pages) in which you discuss the experiences in your life that have formed you as a mathematician or geometer. This essay will be unique to you, but here are some questions that you might consider in your reflection: Were there any turning points in your education? What experiences have stimulated and which have stimied your mathematical growth? Are there obstacles that you have overcome or would like to overcome? How? What are your personal goals in this course? What do you see as personal challenges to being successful? The paper should not be a mere timeline (boring!) or a list of answers to the questions above (disjointed), but instead should be a cohesive essay that focuses on the development of your mathematical ability, confidence, and attitude, centering on a few key turning points. Examples of experiences that help illustrate your statements should be included. How did the class format (lecture, testing, activities, interaction, pacing) change you? Did you have experiences beyond the classroom that affected your mathematical growth?  You may be asked to look back on this essay at the end of the semester to assess personal growth. Your instructor may also use this autobiography to better understand you as a student. In case your instructor knows your past teachers, use pseudonyms or letters to refer to them. The essay should focus on you, not your teachers.    "

Observe how a larger copy of the L-pentomino tile can be created by filling it with four different pentominoes:   The basic L-pentomino next to a L-shaped pentomino built from basic L-, I-, F-, and P-pentominoes.      How are the height and width of the new larger L-tile related to the height and width of the basic L-tile?    How is the area of the new larger L-tile related to the area of the basic L-tile?    Choose another pentomino from among F, I, P, T, U, W, y, and Z, and demonstrate how it can be created using four distinct polyominoes. Note that this cannot be done with X or V.      Use the interactive Polypad activity below or access a fullscreen version at Polypad by Amplify using the link Pentomino Set .     On the other hand, it is possible to create a copy of the V tile that is three times the height and width of the basic V tile by filling it with nine distinct pentominoes.   Show how this can be done.    How does the new area compare with the original?    Explore whether other pentominoes can be tripled in this way.       What happens to the area of a figure when its height and width of are doubled? tripled? How does the number of basic pentominoes needed to fill the figure change?   "

  "title": "Invitation to Apply Knowledge",
  "body": " Invitation to Apply Knowledge    Building a Course Toolbox  Throughout our learning, and in fact throughout our lives, we add knowledge to our toolkit that we can later reference as needed. The tools in our toolkit can then be used to solve problems, to further build our understanding of related concepts, and to support the validity of an argument. Most likely, you are already familiar with some of these tools from previous coursework. You know how to perform computations, have used geometric formulas, and can recognize many shapes.  Although you already know some of the facts and formulas, we will develop a toolbox from the ground up in this course, starting with basic principles and assumptions that are intuitively obvious. With geometric formulas and theorems, we will want to explore why these are true before adding them to our toolbox. When we need to assume a statement without proving it, we will acknowledge the assumption and identify it as a principle rather than a theorem. Theorems will be justified logically from the principles and previously proved theorems. Definitions are developed to give us helpful terminology and state the characteristics needed to identify the object. We typically do not include every property of an object in the definition; some properties can be proved from the initial definition. For example, we define a rectangle to be a quadrilateral with four right angles. The property that opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent is not included in the definition because it can be proved from the definition.  Depending on the level of a geometry textbook and the author's goals, you will see some differences between the statements of geometric definitions and principles (also called axioms). For this reason, a proof you find elsewhere may not be sufficient here due to its reliance on different assumptions. Students are encouraged to use the resources in this text for their work. In addition, you should be mindful of the order in which theorems are introduced as you cannot use a theorem that comes later in the textbook as an argument in a proof. On the other hand, this textbook is not as rigorous as some geometry textbooks. In order to maintain the exploratory and intuitive nature of this book, the author will include some principles here that might appear as proven theorems in other texts. At times, proofs may be included as exercises leaving the choice of rigor up to the course instructor.   Our course toolbox currently contains the definition of area and two principles, and . In other words, we can think about the area of a region as the number of blocks that fill the interior, we can use the area formula for a rectangle, and we know that the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. Hopefully, you will agree that length should also be additive; namely, that if we extend a segment of length by a segment of length , the resulting segment has length . We restate this below:   To view the statements of the earlier principles, click on each corresponding link. .    Additivity of Length   Suppose that is a point on the interior of line segment , then the length of equals the sum of the lengths of and .    Since we are most interested in discovering facts and formulas that will hold for a whole class of geometric shapes, we will often use variables to represent numerical quantities such as length, area, and angle measure. We include in our toolbox the algebraic rules and procedures in that allow us to perform calculations, simplify expressions, and solve equations. There is a section in this book's appendix (back matter) on algebra for your review and reference.  Eventually, we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean Theorem, area formulas for other shapes, and other geometrical theorems and formulas. The reasons behind these will be explored in future sections and based on definitions and the initial principles.  As we encounter and state new definitions, these too will be added to our toolbox. As you work through the next exploration, you will encounter terms like trapezoid and isosceles. Definitions for these and other terms are provided at the end of this section in case you would like to refresh your memory. You can also use the index or textbook's search tool to find definitions.   Explorations with Tangrams   In this exploration, use the tools currently in our toolbox as you answer the questions. You may find yourself wanting to use the Pythagorean Theorem and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions without these formulas. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean Theorem, there is probably an easier method!  A set of tangrams consists of the following seven pieces: two large triangles, one medium triangle, a parallelogram, a square, and two small triangles.   The Seven Tangrams   Seven tangram shapes. The triangles are all isosceles right triangles and the parallelogram is equilateral. The small triangles can be arranged to fill either the square, the parallelogram, or the medium triangle. The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same as the base of the large triangle.    To complete this exploration, you will need to move the seven tangram pieces around. If you do not have a set of tangrams, you may print and cut out the shapes shown above. A tangram interactive is also available on Polypad by Amplify via the link Interactive Tangrams on Polypad by Amplify .    Assume that the length of each side of the square is 1 unit. Determine the area of each of the figures:   The area of the square.    The area of one small triangle.    The area of the parallelogram.    The area of the medium triangle.    The area of the large triangle.       Still assuming that the length of each side of the square is 1 unit, now find the lengths of the sides of the other tangram shapes. You may use the Pythagorean Theorem, but it is possible to determine these lengths without it!    Construct each of the following if possible:   A triangle using three tangram pieces.    A rectangle    A parallelogram that is not a rectangle using two pieces.    A non-isosceles trapezoid (you choose the number of pieces).    A pentagon.    A non-square rectangle using all seven pieces.    A square using all seven pieces.   What is the area of this square?    What is the side length of this square?          Were you able to answer the questions above without using the Pythagorean Theorem or the area formula for a triangle? If not, explore how this might be done!   What tools do we have in our toolbox? How can these help?    In this exercise, we practiced using our initial principles and identified some tools, namely the Pythagorean Theorem and the area formula for a triangle, that will be developed later. We also noted that there are multiple ways to solve a problem. Solutions do not need to use formulas and should evolve from what we know and what we have in our toolbox. Still, we want to grow our toolbox to increase our ability to solve problems and justify claims.  Perhaps you moved figures around and lined up sides to determine whether the lengths were the same.     Defining Polygons  In the first part of this course, we will work primarily with polygons. What is a polygon? Giving a clear, clean definition of the word \"polygon\" is difficult so we will describe it verbally and give several examples. If you search for the definition in books or on the web, you will find different attempts to give a clear definition. We will describe a polygon  polygon as being a closed plane figure formed by a sequence of straight sides. Thus, a polygon is a shape that lies in the plane or on a flat surface. By closed, we mean that a polygon will have a well-defined interior; the polygon forms a solid boundary between this interior and the rest of the plane.   Some examples of polygons    A right trapezoid   A trapezoid with two right angles, one acute angle, and one obtuse angle.     A concave pentagon.      As seen in , we distinguish between convex and concave polygons.   convex  concave  polygon convex  polygon concave   A polygon is convex if every interior angle has a measure less than 180 degrees. If a polygon is not convex, then it is concave .    Not all flat shapes are polygons as illustrated in .   Examples of figures that are not polygons    Not closed.   A figure formed by line segments with a gap remaining.     Curved edges   A closed figure consisting of some straight sides and some curved sides.      Some specific types of polygons are defined below. We add these to our toolbox. An easy way to find definitions later is to use the index at the end of the textbook.    triangle  polygon triangle   A triangle is a polygon with exactly three sides.     quadrilateral  polygon quadrilateral   A quadrilateral is a polygon with exactly four sides.     polygon n-gon  polygon pentagon  polygon octagon  polygon decagon  n-gon  pentagon  octagon  decagon   A pentagon is a polygon n-gon with five sides. A hexagon has six sides. We use the general term -gon to describe a polygon with exactly sides. Other common numerical prefixes used to describe polygons include octa (eight) and deca (ten). These will be explored more in .    Some polygons are defined by the types of angles they have.   right angle  acute angle  obtuse angle  angle right  angle acute  angle obtuse   An angle is said to be a right angle if its measure is 90 degrees. Angles that have measures less than 90 degrees are said to be acute and angles with measures greater than 90 degrees are said to be obtuse .     triangle right  hypotenuse  leg right triangle  right triangle   A triangle is said to be a right triangle if one of its angles is a right angle. In a right triangle, the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse and the other two sides are called legs .     triangle acute  triangle obtuse  acute triangle  obtuse triangle   If one of its angles is obtuse, we say that a triangle is an obtuse triangle . An acute triangle is a triangle with three acute angles. We will explore the measurement of angles more in and .     quadrilateral rectangle  quadrilateral square  rectangle  square   A quadrilateral with four right angles is called a rectangle A square is a rectangle whose sides are all the same length.     equiangular   A polygon is said to be equiangular if all of its angles have the same measure.    Quadrilaterals may also be described by the existence of parallel sides.   parallel lines  parallel sides of a polygon   Two lines in the same plane are said to be parallel if they never intersect. Two line segments or two sides of a polygon are said to be parallel if the lines they are a part of are parallel. Note that a line always extends infinitely in two directions while a line segment has endpoints.     parallelogram  quadrilateral parallelogram  parallelogram altitude  parallelogram base  altitude parallelogram  base parallelogram   A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. When describing the measurements of a parallelogram, it is useful to identify one side as the base . The height of the parallelogram is measured along an altitude , namely a segment formed connecting a point on the side opposite the base to a point on the base such that the altitude meets the line forming the base at a right angle.  In , is a parallelogram since lines and are parallel and lines and are parallel. Segment is an altitude for . The altitude may be drawn from any vertex to an opposite side and may lie in the interior or the exterior of the parallogram.     Two pairs of parallel lines creating parallelogram   Two pairs of parallel lines creating parallelogram      trapezoid  quadrilateral trapezoid  trapezoid altitude  trapezoid base  altitude trapezoid  base trapezoid  leg trapezoid   A quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides is called a trapezoid . One of the parallel sides is called the base and the other is called the summit . The remaining two sides of a trapezoid are called legs . The height of a trapezoid is the distance between the base and the summit, measured along an altitude which is perpendicular to the base.  In , we see that base and summit lie on parallel lines and , respectively. Segments and are legs while is an altitude. Note that the altitude may lie in either the interior or the exterior of the trapezoid.     Trapezoid   Trapezoid ABCD with base BC and summit AD    Triangles and other polygons may also be classified by whether some of their sides have the same length. Two sides of a polygon are said to be congruent  congruent sides if they are the same length.   equilateral triangle  equilateral quadrilateral  rhombus  quadrilateral rhombus  triangle equilateral   A polygon is described as being equilateral if all of its sides are congruent. An equilateral quadrilateral is called a rhombus .     isosceles  isosceles triangle  isosceles trazezoid  triangle isosceles  trapezoid isosceles   The word isosceles comes from two Greek words, isos meaning equal and skelos meaning leg . An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two congruent sides. An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid with two congruent, non-parallel sides.     Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles  Some textbooks will restrict the term isosceles triangle to a triangle with exactly two congruent sides while others allow two or all three of the sides to be congruent. This latter definition is used when one is one wants to argue that properties of isosceles triangles extend to equilateral triangles.   Should you become a teacher, it is wise to be mindful of how your textbook uses these terms. In the early sections of this text, we will distinguish between isosceles and equilateral triangles when you are asked to sketch and identify examples. When we explore properties of triangles, you may use the fact that properties of an isosceles triangle will also hold for equilateral triangles.  In case you are curious, equilateral comes from Latin and French words meaning equal sides.    scalene  triangle scalene   A triangle with no congruent sides is said to be a scalene triangle .     kite  quadrilateral kite   A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent congruent sides. A kite has reflective (fold) symmetry across one of its diagonals.    While area measures the interior region bounded by a polygon or other closed figure in the plane, we can also measure the boundary itself.   perimeter   The perimeter of a closed figure is the total length of its boundary. In the case of a polygon, the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of its sides.      Exercises   Skills and Recall   Determine the perimeter of each of the shapes in .   Review the definition of perimeter . You will have to compute the lengths of some sides. All sides in these figures are horizontal or vertical so that the total horizontal distance from the left boundary to the right boundary is 8 inches in shape 1 and 7 inches in shape 2.    Sketch pictures of each of the following:   An isosceles obtuse triangle    A rhombus that is not a square    An equiangular hexagon which is not equilateral    A concave quadrilateral      Reread definitions as needed and check that your sketches satisfy the criteria.    Triangle , trapezoid , and parallelogram are provided in .   Label a side of triangle as the base. Then draw and label the altitude of the triangle corresponding to that base.    Which two sides of trapezoid could be considered to be bases? Label one as the base. Also label the summit and legs of the trapezoid. Then draw and label an altitude for .    Label side as the base of parallelogram . Sketch and label an altitude for corresponding to base .    Could another side of been chosen as the base? Which one(s)? Would the altitude be the same?      Shapes for   A triangle, a trapezoid, and a parallelogram, all are drawn at an incline.     Check that each altitude is perpendicular to the corresponding base. Multiple answers are possible for most of these questions.    In , three smaller Tangram pieces fill a region congruent to the larger blue isosceles triangle. The square is half as tall as the blue triangle. Suppose that the area of the blue triangle is 18 square inches.   What is the area of one small orange triangle? How do you know?    What is the area of the square? How do you know?      Image for   An isosceles triangle made up of a large isosceles triangle that fills the left half. The right half consists of a square and and two small Tangram triangles, one above the square and one to the right.     Each small triangle has area 4.5 and the square has area 9.     Extending the Concepts   Answer the questions:   Is it possible for a triangle to be equilateral but not equiangular   No   Show by example that it is possible for a quadrilateral to be equilateral but not equiangular.   Thread four straws of equal length in succession with a piece of string and bring the ends together to form a quadrilateral. Must the angles be equal?   A rhombus is equilateral but not necessarily equiangular.   Show by example that it is possible for a quadrilateral to be equiangular but not equilateral.   What must the common angle be? Is there a quadrilateral with angles this size which is not equilateral?   A rectangle is equiangular but not necessarily equilateral.    If two polygons have the same area, must they have the same perimeter? Support your answer using words and\/or pictures.   Experiment, but keep your examples simple. One idea is to pick a number which can be factored in more than one way and let that be the common area. You do not have to use the same shape, but you may choose to use (or not to use) the same number of sides. Your examples should differ from your classmates!    Sketch a polygon where the numerical value of the perimeter is equal to the numerical value of the area. Be sure to label the sides with their lengths.  Now triple the length of each side and recompute the area and the perimeter. What value(s) do you get? Are they still the same?  Assume that the original side lengths had yards as their units. What would the units be for the shape's area?      Again experiment with simple shapes like triangles or rectangles. Multiple examples exist.    We have noted that polygons satisfy additivity of area and that segments satisfy additivity of length. Should polygons satisfy additivity of perimeter? Support your answer with pictures and words.   Draw a picture of two polygons that share a common side. Compute the perimeters of each polygon and of the new shape created. Recall that perimeter is the length of the boundary of the figure and does not include any lengths in the interior.     Writing Prompts   By the time students reach college, they already have some geometry tools in their toolbox. What geometric tools do you bring to the course? Of these tools, which do you feel comfortable using and which do you need to learn more about? You may include tools that we have not yet covered in this textbook.    Explore the Index and Search tools in this textbook. Write a paragraph in which you discuss the benefit of these tools and explain how to use at least one of these tools.     "

You may find yourself wanting to use the Pythagorean Theorem and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions without these formulas. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean Theorem, there is probably an easier method!  A set of tangrams consists of the following seven pieces: two large triangles, one medium triangle, a parallelogram, a square, and two small triangles.   The Seven Tangrams   Seven tangram shapes. The triangles are all isosceles right triangles and the parallelogram is equilateral. The small triangles can be arranged to fill either the square, the parallelogram, or the medium triangle. The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same as the base of the large triangle.    To complete this exploration, you will need to move the seven tangram pieces around. If you do not have a set of tangrams, you may print and cut out the shapes shown above. A tangram interactive is also available on Polypad by Amplify via the link Interactive Tangrams on Polypad by Amplify .    Assume that the length of each side of the square is 1 unit. Determine the area of each of the figures:   The area of the square.    The area of one small triangle.    The area of the parallelogram.    The area of the medium triangle.    The area of the large triangle.       Still assuming that the length of each side of the square is 1 unit, now find the lengths of the sides of the other tangram shapes. You may use the Pythagorean Theorem, but it is possible to determine these lengths without it!    Construct each of the following if possible:   A triangle using three tangram pieces.    A rectangle    A parallelogram that is not a rectangle using two pieces.    A non-isosceles trapezoid (you choose the number of pieces).    A pentagon.    A non-square rectangle using all seven pieces.    A square using all seven pieces.   What is the area of this square?    What is the side length of this square?

Compute the following sums:                    Without actually adding the values, make a prediction for the following sums:                The expression is another way of writing . We write enough addends to establish a pattern and then the tells the reader that the pattern continues. The at the end indicates that the sum will end when the pattern reaches .

Explain how you came up with your formula and why you believe it holds for all . If you were not able to come up with a formula, describe what you have discovered about these sums.      Conjectures and Explanations in Mathematics  Have you ever wondered how mathematics came into existence? A simple answer is that people explored mathematical objects, like numbers or shapes, and noticed patterns and consistencies. They then sought to convince themselves and others that these patterns were not just coincidences but universal properties of the numberic or geometric structure. For example, they observed and then proved that whenever a triangle had two sides of equal length the angles opposite those sides would be congruent.  How do we convince others? In mathematics, we start with basic assumptions like the principles and definitions in this text and then use logic to demonstrate that our conjecture must follow. We also accept the algebraic properties of the real number system along with properties of equality and inequality, allowing us to simplify algebraic expressions and solve linear equalities and inequalities using techniques learned in previous courses. Once we prove a claim, it is no longer a conjecture and is now considered to be a theorem. We can then add the theorem to our toolbox and use it to demonstrate new claims.  Since this textbook is written for students majoring in fields other than mathematics, we will not spend time developing proof-writing techniques. Even so, everyone can benefit from learning to write clear and thorough explanations and demonstrations. Future teachers should develop the ability to explain mathematics carefully and accurately, using words, pictures, and multiple approaches that their students can understand. For a future lawyer or business professional, the practice of writing explanatory papers in mathematics will enhance their ability to present and support arguments for their cases and proposals. As you write explanations, choose an audience that makes sense for you--a student, a friend, a colleague, a jury --and use language appropriate for that audience.  How do we write mathematical explanations and establish new truths? We usually let our readers know what we claim and plan to prove. In geometry, we often accompany our explanations with a sketch on which we have labeled with the names of points and\/or variables for lengths so that our reader can follow our argument visually. We do not assign numerical values to lengths as we do not want to limit our claim to one example.  In , we discovered a formula for the sum of the first odd numbers. It appears to equal , but why? Simply observing the pattern via a few examples, does not convince us that this will also be the case for . Something strange might happen between 5 and 1000. Instead, consider the following proof by pictures :    The first four steps of a pattern are provided.    First, a 1 by 1 square. Second, four 1 by 1 squares arranged to form a 2 by 2 square. Third, a 2 by 2 square with a horizontal 1 by 2 rectangle added to the bottom and a vertical 2 by 1 rectangle added to the right and a 1 unit square in the lower right corner filled in. Finally, a 3 by 3 square has a 1 by 3 rectangle added to the bottom edge, a 3 by 1 rectangle added along the right edge, and a 1 unit square in the lower right corner.    Sketch what the fifth and sixth step of the pattern should look like.   One way of computing the area of the figure in each step is to measure the height and width and multiply. For step one we get , and for step two we get . Use this technique to determine the area of   the third figure.    the fourth figure.    the fifth figure.    the sixth figure.      The area of the third figure can also be found by computing the area of each of the four rectangles that make up the figure, namely . Show and compute the sum of the smaller rectangles   the fourth figure.    the fifth figure.    the sixth figure.        The image to the right shows an -square with two rectangles aligned with the lower and right sides, respectively. The lower right corner has been filled with a 1-unit square.   An arbitrary step in the pattern.     Write the following as unsimplified algebraic expressions with the variable :   The total area found by multiplying the height and length of the figure.    The total area found by adding the areas of the four rectangles.       What algebraic equation or formula does this work suggest? Give an explanation of why it must hold using words, pictures, geometry, and\/or algebra.      A Sample Explanatory Letter  The following letter demonstrates how we might write a thorough, yet informal, explanatory letter. Note the use of variables for a general argument and labeled sketches to help the reader follow our argument.   Dear Aunt Josephine,  I have been thinking about you a lot lately and how much I appreciated your help when I was learning algebra. You may remember how much I struggled with understanding why equals instead of in that course. In my current geometry course, I learned a geometric argument for that equation that makes more sense to me and I thought you might like it too.  In the picture below, you can see a square with side broken up into four rectangles. (Here, I am using in place of .) The area of this square is of course. Notice that is the sum of the areas of the square (top left) and the small square (lower right). These do not fill the entire square so must be greater than . The two missing pieces are rectangles with area . Adding all four pieces, we see .    Visualizing     Now that I have seen this geometrically I remember the formula much better!  I hope you and Uncle Tom are doing well. I look forward to visiting you soon.  Sid   Notice how the author Sid introduces the reader to what will be demonstrated, uses a picture to help the reader visualize the explanation, and then explains in words how the picture justifies the argument. In this example, Sid has to deal with the fact that we typically use the variable in algebra to represent any real number but the variable , representing whole numbers appeared in the sketch. Aunt Josephine is alerted to the fact that would be used in place of and Sid consistently uses in the logical argument. The author could have drawn a new sketch and relabeled it with in place of , but chose not to do so. Since the author is using the sketch from the activity, a citation reference should be included. In fact, if a tool like Polypad or GeoGebra is used to create a sketch, the technology should be credited. Also, note how Aunt Josephine did not have to see the questions in the activity to understand Sid's explanation.   Did you notice the unstated use of in Sid's letter? Explain the role of this principle here.     Exercises   Skills and Recall   Determine two different possibilities for the next term in the sequence . Give reasons for your answers.

  "title": "Invitation to Overcome Challenges",
  "body": " Invitation to Overcome Challenges   Growing through Persistance  Have you ever watched a baby learn a new skill, like walking, crawling, or even rolling over? The child does not master the skill on the first try, but they are determined. They fall down, perhaps bump their head, but they keep trying. They readjust what they are doing, figure out how to create momentum and balance, and finally succeed. Even then they may stumble, but they persist. In the process, they grow stronger and can apply these skills to later learning, like running, climbing the cabinets, and reaching the cookie jar.  Throughout our lives, we grow by challenging ourselves to move beyond our comfort zone. We learn to read and write, play games and sports, cook, make music, or create art. Our brains are muscles that develop as we attempt new challenges. The nature of mathematics involves struggling with a problem, trying different strategies, taking breaks but persisting, and learning from failed attempts. In the explorations of this section, you may find that some of the problems are easy, but others require looking at the problem in new ways and trying different strategies. Accept the challenge, try out different ideas, and don't worry about making mistakes. Allow these attempts to enable growth and eventual success.   Triangles on a Geoboard   You may use tools that you remember from previous courses, such as the area formula for a triangle and the Pythagorean Theorem, as you complete this activity. We will explore why these formulas hold in .    In this exploration, we will work with a geoboard that has four rows and four columns of pins such as the one pictured below.   A grid with 16 dots arranged in four rows and four columns.      Measuring along any row, we will assume that the horizontal distance between neighboring dots on a geoboard is one unit. What is the distance across the top of the geoboard from the leftmost pin to the rightmost pin?    Similarly, the vertical distance between neighboring pins in any column will be one unit. Determine the area of the square whose vertices are the four outermost pins on this geoboard.    Determine the shortest diagonal distance between two pins. In other words, what is the distance from the pin in the upper left corner to the pin in the second row and second column?    What is the distance from the top left pin to the bottom right pin?       As we construct triangles and other shapes on our geoboard, note that each vertex must be one one of the sixteen pins.   To use the embedded interactive GeoBoard via the Polypad by Amplify, select the line tool near the bottom. Then click and drag from one dot to another to create line segments. An easier to use GeoBoard is accessible from apps.mathlearningcenter.org\/geoboard\/ , but gives a 5x5 board instead of 4x4.      Construct a triangle with the smallest possible area. What is the area?     Construct a triangle with the largest possible area. Then construct a second triangle with the same area that is not the same shape as the first. Record your sketches and compute this area.     Interactive tool on Polypad by Amplify         Construct triangles with an area different than any triangle you've already drawn. Counting the triangles you drew in , it is possible to create a total of eight triangles each with a different area. Be sure to record your sketches of the triangles and their areas for reference.    Interactive tool on Polypad by Amplify    The possible areas are .    Extension: If we use a 5x5-geoboard instead, what squares and what triangles are possible? Compute the areas. A virtual 5x5-GeoBoard is available at apps.mathlearningcenter.org\/geoboard\/ .      Confronting the Challenge  To give you the experience of confronting the challenge and the exhilaration of conquering it, the answer to the last task in this exploration will not be provided here. Searching for solutions or examples will not help you grow mathematically. Instead, consider other ways in which you might attack the problem. Dare to try something new!  The above exploration starts off relatively easy. Once you understood how to create and measure shapes on the geoboard, you probably found triangles with areas of , and . In fact, you might have found multiple triangles with these areas. Yet the remaining areas may seem impossible. If you are still in this situation, think about why these same six areas keep occurring. What do these triangles have in common? What other types of triangles exist on the GeoBoard?  As you find these new triangles, another question emerges: How does one compute the area of these triangles? To use the area formula, , one usually uses the values of and . How does one find and with certainty? Or is it necessary to find the base and height of the triangle? Might there be other ways of finding the area in the current setting?  There are many lessons to be learned here that go beyond measuring area. Mathematics is not about doing fast calculations with provided formulas or following steps. Instead, it requires persistence, creative thinking, and exploring multiple strategies. Sometimes it is helpful to walk away from a problem for a little while and to return to it with a different perspective. It helps to share ideas with others even when you do not know where they will lead.  Did you discover a triangle that was not obvious? Did you figure out a way to compute the area of these triangles? Did you help others understand? Be proud of your discoveries and contributions. This is evidence that you, yes you, are a mathematician!  Each student brings their own individual strengths to the class. Some are great at remembering and applying formulas while others are great at drawing sketches. Some have a talent for recognizing patterns or building on others' ideas while other students are adept at explaining results and connections. In fact, you may find yourself contributing in different ways on different activities. The important thing is to believe in yourself and be open to trying new things. Unfortunately, most people believe the myth that they can't do math. They spend too much energy comparing themselves to others. Math is not about being perfect or fast. Instead, mathematics is about exploring, creating, experimenting, conjecturing, applying, and justifying.  If today was not your day to shine, perhaps you were hesitant to consider alternative approaches or to pursue your ideas. This particular topic might not have engaged you in the same way as it did others. Or maybe it was just an off day. There will be more opportunities to overcome challenges throughout this book. As long as you are open to learning and exploring your own ideas, your mathematical ability and confidence will grow. After all, the course has just started, and you are just adapting to this book and its style, your instructor, and your classmates. By the way, your brain may hurt a little as you confront and conquer mathematical challenges. Like every other muscle in your body, a little soreness means that you are growing in strength. Success comes from overcoming the struggle, from remembering and building on your accomplishments and missteps.    A Geometric Tool and an Algebraic Tool  As we have noticed in this section, not all segments are horizontal or vertical. To determine the lengths of these slanted segments on a grid, the Pythagorean Theorem will be helpful. The Pythagorean Theorem allows us to find the lengths of the sides of right triangles using the fact that where is the length of the hypotenuse and and are the lengths of the legs of the triangle. A more in-depth exploration of the Pythagorean Theorem will be pursued in .  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem requires facility with the algebraic operation of squaring and its inverse operation, the square root function. A review of how to work with squares and square roots is provided in in the Backmatter.    Exercises   Skills and Recall   Compute the following numbers if they exist.

Discussion of other emotional stages of this activity is allowed provided that you focus on the emotions associated with the struggle and challenge of conquering a mathematical task.  If this particular activity did not challenge you as much as an earlier one, then your instructor may give you permission to discuss one of those instead.   Growing via Challenges  Reflect on a time when you had to struggle to learn how to do something (not necessarily mathematics), but where you eventually succeeded. Describe the event, why and how you struggled, what helped you persist, and how you grew. Did you feel differently about this success compared to successfully completing routine tasks? Can this experience help you as you tackle tough questions in this course?     "

  "title": "Exploring Area",
  "body": " Exploring Area   In this section, we will determine the area formulas for three shapes: a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be able to explain why they follow from the basic principles of area. In particular, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle, , as a starting point to derive additional area formulas.    Area of a Parallelogram   Discovering an Area Formula for a Parallelogram   Refer to the definition of parallelogram as needed to complete the following.    Sketch the following:   A parallelogram with two different angle measures and two different lengths.    A parallelogram with at least one acute angle and four congruent sides.    A parallelogram with four congruent angles. What do we usually call this parallelogram?    Two parallelograms which share the same side lengths but have different heights.       Beginning with the parallelogram pictured below or the one you sketched in of , explain and demonstrate how you would construct a rectangle with the same area. You are allowed to cut the parallelogram and rearrange or duplicate pieces as part of your argument.    Building on the previous problem, derive an area formula for a parallelogram. Use a combination of words and pictures to explain how it comes from the area formula for a rectangle and how you know it must work for all parallelograms.   Be sure to label the height and base in your pictures. These lengths should stay the same throughout your explanation and clarify the relationship between your parallelogram and rectangle.    Now that we know the area formula for parallelograms and why it works, we may add it to our toolbox and use it as well as the area formula for a rectangle in the next exploration.    The Area of a Triangle   Discovering the Area Formula for a Triangle   You probably remember the area formula for a triangle; in fact, you may have used it already in this course! But why is the area ? This exploration will encourage you to answer that question.    Triangles come in all shapes and sizes. Sketch one or more examples of the following types of triangles.   An equilateral triangle.    A right isosceles triangle.    An acute triangle that is not equilateral.    An obtuse scalene triangle.       To demonstrate WHY the formula, , gives the area for any triangle, construct a parallelogram based on the triangle shown below. How is the area of your parallelogram related to the area of the triangle? Explain.   Resist the urge to use numbers instead of the variables, and . Specific triangles will have numerical dimensions, but we want a formula that will work for all triangles, not just the one you have. Variables allow us to generalize formulas.    A scalene triangle.     A friend (or one of your students) asks you why the area formula for a triangle is . Rewrite and elaborate on your answer to the previous task to give a clear, thorough, and cohesive explanation. Be sure to use words and pictures as needed to make the locations of and clear. The relationship between the triangle and the parallelogram needs to be made explicit as well. Do they have the same height and base? Why or why not? Why must their areas be related and how?     The Area of a Trapezoid  We now have three area formulas in our toolbox:   First Three Area Formulas  area of triangle  area of parallelogram  area of rectangle  triangle area  parallelogram area  rectangle area    Shape  Area Formula  Variables    Rectangle   area , length , width    Parallelogram   area , base , height    Triangle   area , base , height     You may use these three formulas in the next exploration as needed.   The Area Formula for a Trapezoid   We now turn to the trapezoid . Once again, we look at some examples before exploring the formula for area.    Sketch example(s) of each of the following trapezoids:   An isosceles trapezoid.    A trapezoid with one right angle.    A trapezoid with one acute base angle and one obtuse base angle.       Use dissection (cutting), duplication, and\/or rearrangement to construct or deconstruct the trapezoid below into one or more rectangles, parallelograms, and\/or triangles. If you found one method, challenge yourself to do this a second way. Perhaps, you can use just triangles or just parallelograms. Briefly describe your construction or deconstruction.   An arbitrary trapezoid, not isosceles and not a right trapezoid.    GeoGebra interactive for finding the area of a trapezoid     How does your (de)construction demonstrate that the area formula for a trapezoid is ? The steps that follow will assist you in forming a convincing argument.   Choose one of the constructions or deconstructions you created in the previous task. Label the height of the trapezoid with the variable . The summit and base of the trapezoid are typically labeled and , but you are free to name them and if you would like to avoid subscripts. Once you select your labels, you will use them consistently for the remainder of this activity. In my discussion, I will use and to represent the summit and base.   You could even name the summit or if you desire. On the other hand, is a bit long to use in diagrams and formulas so single letters are usually chosen.     Now identify any parts of your other shapes that must have the same length as your trapezoid's height, base, or summit because of the way they were constructed. Label them with the appropriate variable to indicate this equality. Be careful!    You may have created triangles, rectangles, or parallelograms which have, or might have, different base length or height. Any new length or height should be given a different label. If you find that you need to create a lot of new labels, you might want to use a different construction or deconstruction to reduce the amount of algebra you will need to do later.  If you did not create any new length or height, you may skip the next item.    Relate any new labels to the trapezoid's height, base, and\/or summit. For example, if you split the base into three segments, labeled , , and , you would write down the relationship . Is equal to one of the original values? If so, it is often useful to replace by that variable. If you split the base into two segments, one of which is congruent to the summit, you might write or equivalently, .    Compute the areas of any rectangles, parallelograms, or triangles in your construction\/deconstruction, leaving variables in your expressions for each area. Be careful to use the variables assigned in your sketch which may be different than the variables in the standard formulas. For example, if you created an upside-down triangle, its base may be the summit of the trapezoid, and so we would use the label (or ) instead of .    Write a draft of how your (de)construction shows that the area of any trapezoid must be where is the length of the summit, is the length of the base, and is the height. You may be asked to write this explanation more formally outside of class.         Thoughts on Area  Adding the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we now have four area formulas in our toolbox. We could continue to derive the area of more shapes like kites, pentagons, hexagons, etc., but the list would become unwieldy and unhelpful. trapezoid area  area of a trapezoid Instead, we will simply break other polygons into triangles, parallelograms, and other shapes so that we can compute their area. We can then add (or subtract) the areas as appropriate. Measuring tools could be used to estimate the dimensions needed to compute the area of physical space such as floorspace or a garden.   Estimating the Area of Curved Regions  As our shapes become more irregular or curved, we apply the definition of area together with estimation. For these situations, we may superimpose the region over a grid of -unit squares. Of course, the boundary of the region may cross through some squares as shown below.   A curved region on a grid of 1x1-unit squares   a curved shape over a grid of squares      Estimating Area of a Curved Region   Give a rough estimate of the area of the region sketched in . Briefly describe what you did.   There are many, many right answers for this task!    Count the squares that are completely inside the sketched region. This will give an underestimate of the area.    Give an overestimate of the area by selecting and counting a collection of squares that completely encloses the sketched region.    Carefully add a horizontal line halfway between each pair of horizontal lines on the original grid. Similarly add vertical line between each existing pair of vertical lines. This will produce a more refined grid with smaller squares.   Each square on the original grid had an area of 1 unit. What is the area of each new square that you created?    Count the small squares that are entirely inside the region and use this to compute an underestimate of the region.   You may choose to use a mix of original and smaller squares as long as they do not overlap.     Give a more refined overestimate of the area of the region by identifying a collection of squares that encloses the region.       Briefly describe how this method can be used to measure the area of any region to a desired level of precision. What are some limitations to this method?      The Area of a Circle  Although a circle is not a polygon, we can use polygons to derive the formulas for the area and perimeter of a circle.   Defining a Circle  circle  radius  diameter  center circle   A circle is the set of points Here, we consider only points on a single plane or flat surface. that are of equal distance from a point called the center of the circle. This set of equidistant points is sometimes referred to as the circumference of the circle to distinguish it from the interior and exterior of the circle. The radius (pl. radii) refers both to any segment from the center of the circle to a point on its circumference. The term radius can also refer to the length common to all radii. A segment that joins two points of the circle and passes through the center is called a diameter . The length of a diameter is also called the diameter and is twice the length of the radius.  The circle in has a center at point . Radii include , , , and . One diameter is . The distance from to any point on the circumference is 8.7, the radius of the circle.   Terms related to a circle   A circle       Archimedes (287-212 BC) determined the area of a circle by looking at inscribed and circumscribed See for an illustration of these terms. polygons. As the number of sides grew, the area of the polygons would approach the area of the circle, with the area of the inscribed polygons giving a lower estimate and the area of the circumscribed polygons giving an overestimate. The number was not known at the time, but this method provides a means of calculating to any level of precision. Note that . The value is only a rough estimate. In fact, mathematicians have now calculated over sixty trillion digits for . For our purposes, should be sufficient, but space travel engineers usually need about 40 digits of for their work.   Inscribing and circumscribing a circle with squares, octagons, and 16-gons.   Three pictures of the same circle. The first has a square inside with vertices touching the circle and a square outside with the sides' midpoints touching the circle. The second circle has an octagon with vertices on the circle and a larger octagon with its sides' midpoints touching the circle. The final picture has a pair of 16-gons that are almost indistinguishable from the circle between them.    There are two measurements associated with a circle. In addition to area which measures the interior space, we often wish to compute the length of the boundary around the circle. We call this boundary length the circumference of the circle and can think of it as the length of string needed to wrap around the circle. Both area and circumference depend only on the length of the circle's radius .  A technique, similar to the one described for estimating area using polygons of increasing number of sides, can be used to find the circumference or distance around a circle. We give the resulting formula below.    Measuring a circle  circumference  circle circumference  circle area  area circle   The area of a circle is the interior space of a circle and is computed by the formula where is the radius of the circle. The circumference of a circle is the length of its boundary and is given by .        Exercises   Skills and Recall   Compute the areas of the following figures. The boundary of each figure is given by solid lines. Dashed segments are not part of the boundary, but provide additional information that may be helpful.   Triangle where .   Triangle   AB has length 5 centimeters and AC has length 8.8 centimeters. AD meets BC with a right angle at D and AD has length 3.8 centimeters. Side BC has length 11.1 centimeters.      Right Trapezoid .   Trapezoid   Trapezoid DEFG with right angles at D and E. DG has length 6.3 in, GF has length 6.5 in, EF has length 11.6 in, and the height DE has length 3.8 in.      Parallelogram .   Parallelogram   Parallelogram HKLM with HK=8.1 mm, KL=4.8 mm, LM=8.1 mm, and HM=4.8 mm. An altitude drawn from vertex H hitting line MN on the outside of the parallelogram has length 4 mm. The length from the nearest vertex M to the foot of the altitude is 2.7 mm.

Triangle in     Trapezoid in     Parallelogram in       (a) 24.9 cm, (b) 28.2 in, (c) 25.8 mm   (a) , (b) , (c)     Determine both the area and the perimeter of the following figure. Assume that each square of the grid has area 1 square centimeter.   Area    Perimeter      A nonagon   The vertices of the nonagon in clockwise order are (0,9), (3,9), (3,10), (6,10), (9,7), (6,4), (6,0), (3,0), and (0,4).     Area is 60 sq. cm. Perimeter is cm.   For area, the region may be broken up into triangles and rectangles in various ways. The rare student may use parallelograms or trapezoids in their dissection. Some students will likely just count full squares and half squares in each row. With the latter strategy, note that the lower left segment does not divide squares exactly in half.  Perimeter: .     Extending the Concepts   A parallelogram has sides of length 3 inches and length 4 inches and rectangle also has sides of length 3 inches and length 4 inches. Which has the larger area? Use pictures and words to give a clear explanation.   The rectangle RSTU will have the larger area because the height of parallelogram WXYZ will be less than the length of its side.    In , two copies of a circle of radius 5 are given. The circle on the left circumscribes square , meaning that the vertices , , , and lie on the circle. The circle on the right is inscribed in square . Here the circle just touches the square at the midpoint of each side.   Based on the picture, what should be true about the area of the circle relative to the two squares?    Compute the area of square .    Compute the area of square .    Compute the area of the circle.    Do these measurements agree with your expectation?      Square circumscribed by and inscribed in a circle of radius 5.   Square BEFG is circumscribed by a circle of radius 5. Square HIJK is inscribed in a circle of radius 5.     (a) The area of the circle should be between the areas of the two squares. (b) Area of BEFG is 50 sq units. (c) Area of HIJK is 100 sq units. (d) Are of the circle is .     shows a square and an octagon circumscribed by a single circle of radius 4. On the left, an eighth of the octagon is shown to illustrate its height of or approximately .   What do you expect to be true about the areas of the square, the octagon, and the circle? Why?    Compute the area of the square.    Compute the area of the octagon.    Compute the area of the circle.      Square and Octagon circumscribed by a circle of radius 4   A square and octagon are circumscribed by a circle of radius 4. An eighth slice of the octagon has base 4 and height approximately 2.828.     (a) area(square) < area(circle) < area (octagon), (b) area(square) = 32, (c) , (d) .     Writing Prompts   Write a letter to a friend in which you explain how the area of a trapezoid is derived from previously known area formulas such as rectangles, parallelograms, and\/or triangles. See for suggestions on how to write a clear explanation.    Research the history of the number , focusing on a role that geometry played in its discovery or development.     "

  "title": "Exploring Angle Measure",
  "body": " Exploring Angle Measure   Having looked at area as the measure of the interior space of a polygon, we now turn our attention to measuring angles. What is an angle and how do we measure it?    Linear Objects  To fully grasp the definition of angle, we need to first understand the difference between lines, segments, and rays.   line  segment  line segment  distance  length    line     line segment     length of segment     length of segment    A line is a one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in opposite directions. In Euclidean geometry, lines are straight, but we will encounter a geometry in which they are curved. One important trait of lines is that any pair of distinct points lie on exactly one line. For this reason, we may denote the line through points and as .  A line segment is the part of a line bounded by two endpoints. Line segment consists of endpoints  and and all points on line which lie between and .  Unlike a line, a line segment has finite length. We define the length of to be the distance from point to point . We use the notation or simply to denote the length of .    Whereas a line continues infinitely in two directions, a ray continues infinitely in just one direction and has an endpoint.   ray    ray     Ray  consists of point , point , and all points on line which are on the same side of as point . A ray extends infinitely in one direction, has a single endpoint, and cannot be measured.   Note that has many names. If is any point on other than , then .       Defining and Measuring Angles  We now define an angle and describe how to measure angles.   angle  vertex angle  angle vertex  angle side  side angle   An angle is the union of two rays with a common endpoint. In particular, , shown in , consists of all points that lie on the rays and . The common endpoint of the rays is called the vertex of the angle and the two rays and are called the sides of the angle.    Angle   angle BAC     To think of the measure of an angle as the space between the rays is vague and misleading. The area between the rays is infinite. Note also that the points and on the sides of do not play a role in defining or measuring the angle. If is any other point on ray other than , then is the same angle as and hence has the same measure. Thus it would make no sense to use the linear distance between and for measuring . The sides of an angle are infinite and extend beyond what can be drawn.  Instead, we think of angle measurement in terms of rotational movement around the vertex, specifically the amount of rotation needed to move one side of the angle on top of the other.   To begin our study of angle measure, we will adopt the practice of assuming that there are 360 degrees in a full rotation about any point. The choice of 360 can be traced back to the Babylonians who were studying planetary paths around 400 B.C. and used a base 60 (instead of base 10) number system. One advantage of the number 360 is that it has a lot of factors including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. This results in more pleasing numbers when we consider fractions of a circle.    Full rotation about point .   A circle centered around point A. An arrow has been added to the circle to indicate rotation in a counterclockwise direction.      Suppose point lies between points and on line as shown in . In this case, we say that rays and are opposite rays opposite rays  rays opposite . Since , a rotation of 180 degrees will take the ray to the ray on the opposite side of .   180-degree rotation about point   Line containing C A and B from left to right. Semicircular arc drawn with center A from point B to the line on the opposite side of A.     Continuing, we define the measurement of angles according to what fraction of a full (or half) rotation they represent. Notice how the protractor in divides the semicircular arc into 180 segments, eighteen of which are labeled with numerical values. These multiples of ten are fractions of the half rotation 180 degrees, for example . To find the measure of , we place the center dot of the protractor over the vertex of the angle and lined up ray with the mark for 0 degrees. The other side of the angle passes through the mark for 40 degrees.   Using a protractor to measure angles.    A protractor aligned with line containing C A B, centered at point A. Labels for every multiple of 10 degrees from zero degrees up through 180 degrees are shown, both clockwise and counterclockwise. Ray AD passes through the indicator for 40 degrees.      Reading a Protractor  Use the picture above to determine the following:   The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .    The measure of angle .        What fraction of a full rotation is 40 degrees?    What fraction of a full rotation is 110 degrees?     Use a physical protractor and a ruler to draw an angle with measure 78 degrees. Describe your technique.  It is possible to have angle measures greater than 180 degrees. Use words and\/or pictures to describe an angle that measures 240 degrees.   We give a more concise definition of angle measure and introduce the notion of angle congruence.   angle measure  measure angle    angle measure    The measure of , written , is the number of degrees of rotation about vertex needed to move ray onto .     congruent angles    congruent angles    If two angles and have the same measure, we say that the angles are congruent and write . Thus, means .     Note the use of the equals sign in where the two sides of the equation represent numbers. The symbol relates geometrical objects of the same type.     Angles of a Triangle    The GeoGebra app, is useful in completing this activity. You may also perform this activity by carefully cutting out a scalene triangle and tracing it on a sheet of paper.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for .      Rotate triangle 180 degrees about the midpoint of side (see hint). Both the original triangle and the rotated version should be visible. What do you notice?  Note that two of the points are double labeled, once for each triangle. If you rightclick on the label, you can move it to make the original label visible.   To perform this rotation in the GeoGebra app, click on the angle rotation icon in the toolbar. Next, click on the interior of the triangle to select the object to be rotated, then click on midpoint to identify the center of the rotation. When prompted to input the angle measure, replace 45 with 180. Then click OK.    Also rotate 180 degrees about the midpoint of side .   Which angle of is congruent to ?    Which angle of is congruent to ?       What does this tell you about ? Explain how the picture shows this.    Make a claim about the sum of the interior angles of a triangle.  Does your claim work for all triangles or just the one in the picture? To test this in the GeoGebra applet, select the arrow in the tool menu. Then click and drag one of the vertices in the original triangle to change the shape. Do your claims still hold?   GeoGebra makes exploring multiple possibilities easier. If you are doing this activity with paper triangles, experiment with other triangles, repeating the previous tasks. If your classmates used different triangles, this would be a good time to compare results.       Additivity of Angles and Definitions Associated with Angles  Like additivity of area and additivity of length , the additivity of angle measure is intuitively obvious and will prove useful. We state this as a principle and add it to our toolbox. First, we must clarify what we mean by the interior of an angle.   interior angle  angle interior   A point is said to be in the interior of if and lie on the same side of line and and lie on the same side of line . Ray lies in the interior of if lies in the interior of .     Additivity of angle measure   Angle BAC with interior ray AD     Additivity of Angle Measure   If ray lies in the interior of angle , then .         Vertical Angles  To conclude this section, we will use what we have learned to make a claim about vertical angles.   angle vertical  vertical angle   When a pair of lines intersect, two pairs of vertical angles are formed. The point where the lines intersect will be the vertex for each angle in a vertical pair and the sides of one angle will be the opposite rays of the sides of the other angle in the pair.      Determine two pairs of vertical angles in the figure to the right.   Lines intersecting to form vertical angles   Two lines meet at point E. One line contains points A, E, and B in order and the other contains points C, E, and D in that order.      Each pair of vertical angles consists of two angles.   One pair consists of and . The other pair of vertical angles are and .    What must be true about the measures of any pair of vertical angles? Give a thorough explanation of why this must be true using .

Going clockwise around point E, we have A, C, I, B, F, and J.        Points E and F are the only labeled points that lie on the segment .    Points C, H, E, F, and D lie on line .

Diagonals AE and BD meet at point C. Point F lies on side BE.                                  The sum . Other answers are possible with adequate support.       Extending the Concepts    Must the right angle be the largest angle of a right triangle? Explain how this follows from results of this section.    Sketch any convex quadrilateral on paper or using the GeoGebra drawing tool.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for Quadrilateral Angle Sum Exercise.    Connect opposite vertices and with a line segment, called a diagonal , to divide the quadrilateral into two shapes.   What two shapes did this create?    What does this tell you about the angle sum of a convex quadrilateral? Explain in words and pictures why this will be true for all convex quadrilaterals.    Experiment with other triangles or by moving vertex in the applet. Does your claim still hold true? What happens to the angle measure when the quadrilateral is no longer convex?      Different interpretations of angles in a concave quadrilateral can be made here. In your explanation, you may need to specify whether you are looking only at interior angles or only considering angles less than 180 degrees.     "

  "body": " What Does Parallel Mean?   What does it mean for two lines to be parallel? Remembering that lines continue indefinitely, we define two lines in the same plane to be  parallel if they never intersect. In this section, we will look more closely at this definition, explore properties related to parallel lines, and explore what lines look like in other geometries.    What do we remember about lines on a plane?   Reflecting on Prior Understanding   In your own words, write three different endings to the statement, A line is ... . Compare your responses to that of your classmates.   There are no right or wrong answers!    Complete the following sentences:   The sum of the measures of the interior angles of any triangle is ...    Two lines in the plane are parallel if ...      This question is also designed to lead to discussion without judgement. Students usually agree on 180 degrees for the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle. They should give a variety of ideas on what parallelism means. For a later question, we will use nonintersecting to define parallel lines.      Geometry on Another Surface  In school, we typically consider lines to lie on a flat surface called a plane. While most of this textbook will follow this tradition, we take a brief departure from planar geometry in this section. The world we live on is not flat; it is roughly spherical. What objects might act like lines on the surface of a sphere? Do spherical lines have the same properties as lines on a plane? One could also study the behavior of lines in our universe: Are they straight or do they bend? What can we say about parallel lines in these environments? Do our familiar properties hold?   Defining Lines on a Sphere   For this activity and the one that follows, you will need a small sphere, some rubber bands large enough to go around your sphere, a protractor, a marker, and a piece of thread. Possible spheres include styrofoam balls, oranges, rubber balls, or spheres sold by math education supply companies. Aim for a sphere around the size of a softball. A smooth surface is best, but any small ball will suffice. As an alternative, you may use a ribbon with a globe where latitude and longitude lines are marked.   Envisioning Lines on a Sphere  We do not live on a plane; we live on a sphere. Let’s predict what objects on a sphere might act as lines. These lines will lie on the surface of the sphere. They will not pass through the sphere nor will they project out into space. What are some examples of things that might pose as “lines” on a sphere? Which of your descriptions in do they satisfy?    You have probably heard the expression, The shortest distance between two points lies along a line. We shall use this property of line segment to determine which linear features on a sphere act as lines and line segments. Suppose you have plans to fly from Chicago, Illinois (41.8781N, 87.6298W) to Rome, Italy (41.9028N,12.4964E). There are many paths you could take; some might qualify as lines under your suggestions above. Which path gives the shortest distance from Chicago to Rome? If a globe is available, find Chicago and Rome and experiment with a string to find the path of least distance. If you do not have a globe, mark the approximate locations of Chicago and Rome on your sphere; each should be midway between the equator and the North Pole, with Rome approximately a quarter of the way around east of Chicago. Tighten the string connecting these two cities to observe the path of shortest distance between them.   Describe this line segment. Does it follow a latitude line? Bend toward the North Pole? Bend toward the equator?    Allow this “line” to extend “forever” beyond the two points. What figure does it form? How is this figure related to the sphere itself?      1. The line segment does not follow the latitude line. It bends toward the North Pole.  2. The line extends to a circle around the sphere with the same radius and center.    The lines on a sphere are simply the great circles. A great circle is a circle on a sphere that has the same diameter as the sphere itself. If you were to cut a sphere along a great circle, you would split the circle into two hemispheres of the same size. Restrict yourself to this definition of line for the next exploration.   In , the circle through , , and and the circle through and are great circles because they have the same diameter and center as the sphere. The circle through , , and is not a great circle.    Spherical objects   A sphere showing two great circles, one of which is the equator. It also shows a smaller circle, like the Arctic Circle.      Properties of Spherical Lines and Triangles    Which latitudes, if any, will be lines (great circles) on a sphere?    Which longitudes, if any, will be lines on a sphere according to this definition?    In , we defined two lines to be parallel if they lie in the same plane and do not intersect. Spherical lines will be parallel if they lie on the sphere and do not intersect.  Choose any point on the sphere which is not on the equator. Can you construct a spherical line through this point that does intersect the equator? Explain.    What do you expect to be true about the sum of the interior triangles of a spherical triangle? On your sphere, plot three points that do not lie on the same line and connect them with spherical lines (rubber bands) to form spherical triangles. Make sure that each rubber band is as straight as possible, forming a great circle.    To measure the angles on a sphere, pass a piece of thread through the vertex hole of a protractor and tie it securely. Hold the protractor with that hole at the vertex of the angle you wish to measure, aligning the baseline of the protractor with one side of the angle. By pulling the thread tight and visually aligning it with the second side of the angle, you should be able to read the measure on the protractor as demonstrated in .  Record the measurements of each of the three angles of your triangle and then add the three measures.   Angle A:    Angle B:    Angle C:    Sum:      Don't force the sum to be 180 degrees. Results on a sphere may be different than on a plane.    Repeat the last task two more times so that you have computed the sum of the measures of the angles for at least three different triangles. Record your measurements and sums. What do you notice?   You should find that spherical triangles behave differently from triangles in the plane.    What is the largest triangle you can make on the sphere? Describe it and then determine the sum of its interior angles.   You get to define largest here and your definition may differ from that of other classmates. Hence, your results may also differ!    Make a conjecture as to the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a spherical triangle. Test your conjecture with additional triangles.     Measuring Angles on a Sphere      Understanding Parallel Lines  Most likely, and led to some observations that surprised you. One of the ways in which spherical geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that no lines on the sphere are parallel. Of course, we could have defined line differently, but that would have led to a loss of other properties of lines, such as the existence and uniqueness of a line joining any pair of points. Hence, we need to be clear regarding the geometry being studied. Except where specified, our work will be limited to Euclidean geometry where lines lie on planes, not spheres. In Euclidean geometry, parallel lines exist. In fact, for each point and line not passing through >, we can draw exactly one line through that is parallel to >. We will accept this statement, known as Playfair's Parallel Postulate, as one of our principles.    Playfair's Parallel Postulate   Given a line and a point not on , there is one and only one line that passes through and is parallel to .     Exactly one line through parallel to line .    In order to be parallel, two lines must lie in the same plane. If you are reading this indoors, you probably have a wall in front of you and a wall somewhere to your right. The line where the ceiling meets the wall in front of you will never intersect the line formed by the intersection of the floor and the wall to your right. Still, we do not consider these two lines to be parallel because there is no plane containing both lines. Instead, we say that these are skew lines .   Although it appears that the two lines meet on the right, that is only a result of displaying a three-dimensional image on a two-dimensional surface. In reality, the top back line stays at the level of the ceiling and the lower front line stays on the floor. They do not meet.    Illustrating skew lines as edges on a rectangular room.   Rectangular box: front face has vertices A, B, C, and D counterclockwise starting in lower left corner. On the back face, the verices G, H, F, and E are counterclockwise starting in lower left, so that edges AG, BH, CF, and DE join the front and back faces.    Check your Understanding  Refer to as you answer the following.   In the figure, it looks like and should intersect. Explain why they do not intersect when we think of the figure as a three-dimensional rectangular box or room.    Identify a second line (extension of an edge of the box in the picture) that would be considered to be skew to .    How many lines suggested by edges of this box are parallel to ? Name them.      We also observed that angle measures in spherical triangles did not behave in the way that Euclidean triangles do. This suggests that the measures of angles may be related to the parallel postulate. Indeed the two concepts are closely connected. In , we rotated a triangle 180 degrees about a midpoint of one of its sides and again around the midpoint of a second side. We then observed that the three angles formed a line when placed side by side at a vertex. We now look at that exploration in the context of parallelism.   Alternate Interior Angles   In the following application, triangle has been rotated 180 degrees about midpoint of side to form . Note that point coincides with and point coincides with .   An interactive GeoGebra applet for Exploration on Alternate Interior Angles.       What appears to be true about lines and ?    What other two lines appear to have this property?    Verify your observation by using the parallel line tool in the app. After selecting parallel lines from the line tool menu, click on the line segment it should be parallel to and then click on the point it should pass through.       What can we say about the relationship between angles and    In terms of angle measure? How do you know?   An angle measurement tool is provided in the app if you choose to use it. Click on the three points defining the angle in counterclockwise order with the vertex of the angle being the second of the three. You may be able to give an explanation that does not use actual measurement.     In terms of their relationship to the parallel lines, and and the line ?    In terms of triangle and its rotated copy ?       When a line cuts across two other lines, we call it a transversal of the lines. In , transversal transversal cuts across two parallel lines and .   Transversal cuts across parallel lines and .   From left to right, points A, B, and F lie on a line and points G, C, and D lie on a line parallel to AB. The transversal contains points H, C, B, and E read from bottom to top.      alternate interior angles  alternate exterior angles  corresponding angles   When a transversal, such as in cuts across lines and so that and are on opposite sides of , angles and are said to be alternate interior angles .  In , we call and  alternate exterior angles since points and lie on the transversal on opposite sides of the two parallel lines and points and lie on different parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal.  Angles and are called corresponding angles because they lie in the same relative position; in this case to the left of the transversal and below a parallel line.    Although we will not give a proof, the following two statements are equivalent to Playfair's Parallel Postulate. These principles hold in Euclidean geometry where Playfair's Parallel Postulate is assumed, but fail in non-Euclidean geometries like the Spherical Geometry we studied in and .   Alternate Interior Angles   Given two parallel lines and and a line that crosses and , alternate interior angles have the same angle measure.     Angle Sum of a Triangle   The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees.       Exercises   Skills and Recall   In , a pair of alternate interior angles, a pair of alternate exterior angles, and a pair of corresponding angles was identified for . Use to identify the following:   A second pair of alternate interior angles.    A second pair of alternate exterior angles.    Three more pairs of corresponding angles.       In , we claim that alternate interior angles are congruent.   Use this principle to argue that alternate exterior angles and in have the same angle measure.    Give a thorough argument that corresponding angles and in must be congruent.       In , parallel lines and are cut by transversals and . The transversals meet at point . The measure of is 57 degrees and the measure of is 114 degrees.  Determine the measures of the angles:                                        Illustration for    Transversals AC and BD cut parallel lines AB and CD and meet at point E. Order of points on each line: Left to right: H-A-B-I and J-C-D-K. Top to bottom: F-A-C-E and G-B-D-E.       Extending the Concepts   Suppose that lines and are not parallel (so that they must meet at a point ) and that line cuts and at points and , respectively. Let be a point on line on the opposite side of . Explain why     Image from Coxeter's 1957 Address to the Royal Society of Canada   Hyperbolic disc model    The illustration in was explored by mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter and used by artist M. C. Escher as a basis for his Circle Limit series of prints. This illustration suggests another type of non-Euclidean geometry, a disc model of hyperbolic geometry. Here, lines are of two types: diameters of the outer disc and circular arcs that meet the outer disc at a right angle The tangents of these circles and the tangent of the outer disc at the point of intersection are perpendicular. .  In , line is the curved arc We ignore the section outside the outer disc. It is include to show how these lines are parts of circles. shown in orange about halfway between the top and the center, , of the outer disc. Point is below the center on the same diameter as ; thus, is that diameter. Line has been drawn to illustrate the fact that not all lines are visible in the design; in fact, given any two points in the interior of the disc, there is one and only one line passing through both points.    Distance is measured differently in this geometry. The curved triangular shapes near the edge that look tiny to our Euclidean eyes are actually congruent to the shapes near the center. Lines actually continue indefinitely even though they are bounded by the edge of the disc.   To our Euclidean eyes, line segment appears to do which of the following:   be straight    bend in toward the center    bend away from the center      To our Euclidean eyes, line segment appears to do which of the following:   be straight    bend in toward the center    bend away from the center      Consider triangle . Do you think that the sum of the angle measures will be equal to 180 degrees, less than 180 degrees, or more than 180 degrees?   Recalling that two lines are said to be parallel, sketch three different hyperbolic lines that are parallel to and pass through ? You may use points that have not yet been labeled.   As noted, not all lines are shown in the sketch. In fact, for any two points in the interior of the disc, either a diameter or arced line can be drawn. Do you think there are no lines, exactly one line, several lines, or an infinite number of hyperbolic lines that pass through and are parallel to ? Support your answer by words and\/or illustrations.   Coxeter's disc with points and lines added. Original image found in . Markings added using GeoGebra.   Poincare disc described in problem.      Writing Prompts   Write a letter to a friend in which you discuss some of the commonalities and differences between Euclidean and spherical geometry that you learned about in this section. As an optional extension, you might explore some other differences including whether spherical lines are infinite or finite and whether betweenness of points on spherical lines are preserved.     "

In this section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings can be used to tile the plane.   The material in this section has been adapted from Section 4.1 in Symmetry, Shape, and Space .     Regular Polygons  We begin by defining what it means for a polygon to be regular.   regular polygon  polygon regular   A polygon is a regular polygon if all of its sides and all of its angles are congruent.     Check Your Understanding!  Explain why each shape below is not a regular polygon:   Nonregular Polygons   Rhombus ABCD with obtuse angles at B and D, Rectangle EFGH with height 6 and width 10, and a House-shaped pentagon with base length 4, wall height 4, and total height 6.       Regular Tilings  In , we created a tiling of a square using tetrominoes. In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues infinitely, we will not be able to create a complete tiling. However, we will be able to build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.   tiling  tiling regular  regular tiling  tiling monohedral  monohedral tiling   A tiling is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no gaps and no overlaps. A monohedral tiling is a tiling that uses only one shaped tile while a regular tiling is a monohedral tiling that uses a single regular polygon as its tile. In a regular tiling, each side of a polygon will line up perfectly with a side of an adjacent c.     Regular Tilings   This activity may be completed using physical tiles or in the interactive applet below. Be sure to save a record of your designs by tracing, photography, or screenshots. Some of the computations will also be used later in this section, so you are encouraged to keep an accessible record of your work for future reference.  The web application Polypad by Amplify provides regular -gons for . These are the top six shapes provided. Simply drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area and it will make a new copy.

Fullscreen, undo, redo, reset, and extract buttons are provided on the right.    Interactive tool for tiling on Polypad by Amplify.       Select a single regular polygon, make copies of it as needed, and use it to construct a regular tiling. Construct enough of the tiling to convince others that the tiling can continue to tile the plane, upward and downward, to the left and the right, with no gaps and overlaps.    Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, regular hexagons, and other regular -gons to determine which can be used to create a regular tiling and which cannot. What do you think will happen with regular polygons with more than eight sides? Why?    Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure plays a role in determining whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. The steps in this task will lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other regular -gons.    A triangulated regular pentagon   A regular pentagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The interior angle at A has been split by diagonals into angles 1, 2, and 3. Angle D has been split into angles 4 and 5. Angle C has been split into angles 6 and 7.    The following shorthand will be used to refer to the angles.                        , etc.        Explain why     What is ?    Use the fact that the pentagon is divided into triangles to determine .    Having just computed the sum of the five congruent angles of a regular pentagon, determine .    Some of what you found, but not all, will be true for all convex pentagons. What results about angle measure will also hold for non-regular convex pentagons? What will be different?       Use your work from the previous task to complete the row for regular pentagon in the table below. Repeat this procedure for squares, regular hexagons, regular octagons, and regular decagons: First draw diagonals from a single vertex to dissect the polygon into triangles, next use the triangles to determine the total vertex angle measure, and then determine the measure of each angle. In the final row, is a variable representing the number of sides and the answers will be algebraic expressions involving the variable .

How many squares can meet at a single point?    How many regular hexagons can meet at a single point?    Explain in words and pictures why these three regular polygons can each produce a regular tiling.    When we tried to surround a point with regular pentagons a gap was formed. What is the degree measure of that gap?    If , do you know whether a regular -gon might produce a regular tiling? Include a discussion of vertex angle measure in your explanation.       In , we determined the measure of a vertex angle of a regular -gon. We define this term and another important angle.   vertex angle  central angle  angle of polygon vertex  angle of regular polygon central  polygon vertex angle  regular polygon central angle  center of regular polygon  regular polygon center   A vertex angle of a polygon is any angle which shares its vertex with that of the polygon. The sides of a vertex angle lie along the two sides of the polygon, meeting at the vertex.  When a polygon is regular, we can also define its center to be the point which is equidistant from all vertices of the polygon. A central angle of a regular polygon has its vertex at the center of the polygon and its sides consist of a pair of rays emanating from the center to two adjacent vertices.      Semiregular Tilings  If we allow more than one regular polygon to be used in a tiling, we are able to create a wider variety of designs.   tiling semiregular  semiregular tiling  tiling monohedral  vertex arrangement tiling   A semiregular tiling is a tiling consisting of two or more regular polygons with common side lengths with the additional requirement that the arrangement of polygonal faces around every vertex is the same.  We can denote the vertex arrangement by identifying the number of sides in each polygon as we travel around a vertex. An example of this is the 3.3.4.3.4-vertex arrangement, referring to triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square. This arrangement is shown in and will be discussed in the next exploration.     In Search of Semiregular Tilings   Once again, you are encouraged to continue the practice of saving your sketches, work, and results as they may be useful later in this section.    What must be true about the measures of the angles of the vertices meeting at and surrounding a single point?    In , you determined the vertex angle measure for a few regular polygons and developed a general formula for finding this measure. Use the formula, to determine the vertex angle measure of each of the following regular -gons. If the answer is not a whole number, write the answer as a mixed number.   heptagon (7 sides)    nonagon (9 sides)    dodecagon (12 sides)    pentakaidecagon (15 sides)    octakaidecagon (18 sides)    icosagon (20 sides)    tetrakaicosaigon (24 sides)    tetracontakaidigon (42 sides)      The measure of the vertex angle of a regular -gon is given by the formula .    Refer to as you answer the following:   Verify that the sum of the angles meeting at the vertex is 360 degrees.    Extend the design making sure that you always have one or two triangles between any two squares. Will this eventually fill the plane without gaps or overlaps?    Note that gives a different pattern. Show that it is possible to create a tiling using the vertex arrangement by building outward from your initial vertex arrangement.      A 3.3.4.3.4 (triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square) vertex arrangement.   A tiling with vertex arrangement 3.3.4.3.4      Verify arithmetically that it is possible for an equilateral triangle, a regular heptagon, and a regular tetracontakaidigon (pictured below), to fit snugly around a vertex with no overlaps. In shorthand, we can write this vertex arrangement as .   A tetracontakaidigon (42-gon).   A regular 42-sided polygon.      Use the angle measures you found in and to list all combinations of three, four, or five regular polygons that could meet at a vertex, writing the vertex configurations in shorthand notation. Like the example in , the same shape may be repeated. If more than three polygons meet at a vertex, consider the different ways in which they could be arranged.   Note that and are potentially two other ways of writing in . We could begin at any polygon and list the polygons in order. To avoid these repetitions, it is standard practice to begin with the polygon with the smallest number of sides and then move to its neighbor with the smallest number of sides, continuing around until all the polygons around the point have been named. Similarly, we write rather than for the tiling where the two squares are adjacent.    We are not including the three regular tilings in this list. There is one more vertex arrangement using five polygons (in addition to 3.3.4.3.4 and 3.3.3.4.4), five using four polygons, and eight more using three polygons (in addition to 3.7.42).    Some of the vertex arrangements in the previous task will extend to create a semiregular tiling, but not all of them! Experiment by surrounding one vertex using the pattern and then try to surround the neighboring vertices using the same arrangement. Which seem to work and which fail? For the ones that fail, what seems to go wrong?   Only eight of the seventeen possible vertex arrangements can be used to create a semiregular tiling.    What do you notice about the vertex arrangements that work (or those that don't work)? What do you wonder?    This activity may have involved more of a struggle than some of the others. Perhaps you only found about half of the possibilities in or you cannot yet see a pattern to help determine which vertex arrangements lead to a semiregular tiling. That is perfectly normal. Write down the ideas that you do have and share them with classmates. As you share what you have observed and listen to others' discoveries, you and your classmates may uncover some amazing results.    Narrowing Down the Options  When we look at possible vertex arrangements for a semiregular tiling, our options are very limited. Not including the regular tiling by squares, you should have found three groups of four regular polygons with an angle sum of 360 degrees. All of these have at least one polygon appearing twice. Why do some of these extend to a semiregular tiling while others do not? Does it matter whether the common polygons are next to each other or separated?  As we attempt to create a 3.3.6.6 pattern, we find that it is impossible to maintain a consistent vertex arrangement. Fairly quickly, we are forced to create a 3.6.3.6 arrangement at some vertices. On the other hand, a 3.3.6.6 vertex arrangement can continue indefinitely. Let us explore why this happens.   Semiregular Tilings with Four Regular Polygons at a Vertex   Use physical or virtual triangles and hexagons to sketch the vertex arrangement 3.3.6.6 or refer to an earlier sketch if available. The Polypad by Amplify applet in may be used.   Choose one of the two triangles at this vertex and attempt to surround it with triangles and\/or hexagons while maintaining the 3.3.6.6 arrangement at each vertex.    Note that each triangle in a 3.3.6.6 must share a side with one triangle and one hexagon due to the order of the 3's and 6's.   Surrounding a regular triangle with regular triangles and regular hexagons.    Will the remaining side abut a triangle or a hexagon? Discuss what happens in each case.        There is a second group of four regular polygons consisting of two equilateral triangles and two other polygons.   What are the other two polygons? We will represent the number of sides of these polygons by and .    Explain why the arrangement will not extend to a semiregular tiling using an argument similar to what we did with .    Explain why the arrangement also fails to create a semiregular tiling.       The remaining semiregular tiling with four polygons meeting at each vertex has two squares and two other polygons in the vertex arrangement.   What are the other two polygons? Again, the number of sides of these two polygons are represented by and in the questions that follow.    Are you able to surround a square along its sides by an alternating sequence of -gons and -gons?    One of the polygons has an odd number, , of sides. Are you able to surround the -gon along its sides by an alternating sequence of squares and -gons?    Explain in words and pictures why extends to a semiregular tiling, but does not. Draw or record a sketch of if you do not already have one.       We conclude that there are only two semiregular tilings and one regular tiling of the plane where four polygons meet at a vertex. All three vertex arrangements with five polygons meeting extend to semiregular tilings. To complete this analysis, we consider which three-polygon vertex arrangements extend to a semiregular tiling.   Semiregular Tilings with Three Regular Polygons at a Vertex   Not including the regular tiling , there are nine possible vertex arrangements consisting of three regular polygons. List as many as you can, referring back to the work you did in .    Verify algebraically that can surround a single point.    Use the fact that 5 is an odd number to explain why does not extend to a semiregular tiling. You may include pictures as well as words in your explanation.   What happens as you try to surround a pentagon with the necessary pentagons and decagons?    Determine the three vertex arrangements with three polygons that extend to a semiregular tiling. Why must the others be eliminated?      Exercises   Building Our Toolbox  As we conclude this long section, it is wise to reflect on what we have learned. What should we add to our toolbox for later use? Definitions for regular polygons, tilings, regular tilings, and semiregular tilings were introduced at the beginning of the section. You should also note the items below:   In your own words and pictures, describe the difference between a regular and a nonregular polygon.    If a group of polygons meet at a single vertex, what must be the sum of the angle measures at that vertex? Note that this wording generalizes this fact to nonregular polygons as well.    Describe the three regular tilings.    What is the sum of the measures of the vertex angles for any (not necessarily regular) convex -gon? For example, the measures of the angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees. What is the total for a convex quadrilateral, a convex pentagon, etc.?    What formula can be used to compute the angle measure for a regular -gon?    What do we mean by a -vertex arrangement?    Just because a collection of regular polygons can surround a vertex does not mean that they can create a semiregular tiling. Give an example of a vertex arrangement that does not extend to a regular tiling. Support your claim.     Skills and Recall   Sketch a picture of each of the following:   A concave octagon    A convex hexagon that is not regular    A rectangle that is a regular quadrilateral.

Select a single regular polygon, make copies of it as needed, and use it to construct a regular tiling. Construct enough of the tiling to convince others that the tiling can continue to tile the plane, upward and downward, to the left and the right, with no gaps and overlaps.    Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, regular hexagons, and other regular -gons to determine which can be used to create a regular tiling and which cannot. What do you think will happen with regular polygons with more than eight sides? Why?    Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure plays a role in determining whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. The steps in this task will lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other regular -gons.    A triangulated regular pentagon   A regular pentagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The interior angle at A has been split by diagonals into angles 1, 2, and 3. Angle D has been split into angles 4 and 5. Angle C has been split into angles 6 and 7.    The following shorthand will be used to refer to the angles.                        , etc.        Explain why     What is ?

Use your work from the previous task to complete the row for regular pentagon in the table below. Repeat this procedure for squares, regular hexagons, regular octagons, and regular decagons: First draw diagonals from a single vertex to dissect the polygon into triangles, next use the triangles to determine the total vertex angle measure, and then determine the measure of each angle.

What must be true about the measures of the angles of the vertices meeting at and surrounding a single point?    In , you determined the vertex angle measure for a few regular polygons and developed a general formula for finding this measure. Use the formula, to determine the vertex angle measure of each of the following regular -gons. If the answer is not a whole number, write the answer as a mixed number.   heptagon (7 sides)    nonagon (9 sides)    dodecagon (12 sides)    pentakaidecagon (15 sides)    octakaidecagon (18 sides)    icosagon (20 sides)    tetrakaicosaigon (24 sides)    tetracontakaidigon (42 sides)      The measure of the vertex angle of a regular -gon is given by the formula .    Refer to as you answer the following:   Verify that the sum of the angles meeting at the vertex is 360 degrees.    Extend the design making sure that you always have one or two triangles between any two squares. Will this eventually fill the plane without gaps or overlaps?    Note that gives a different pattern. Show that it is possible to create a tiling using the vertex arrangement by building outward from your initial vertex arrangement.      A 3.3.4.3.4 (triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square) vertex arrangement.   A tiling with vertex arrangement 3.3.4.3.4      Verify arithmetically that it is possible for an equilateral triangle, a regular heptagon, and a regular tetracontakaidigon (pictured below), to fit snugly around a vertex with no overlaps. In shorthand, we can write this vertex arrangement as .   A tetracontakaidigon (42-gon).   A regular 42-sided polygon.      Use the angle measures you found in and to list all combinations of three, four, or five regular polygons that could meet at a vertex, writing the vertex configurations in shorthand notation. Like the example in , the same shape may be repeated. If more than three polygons meet at a vertex, consider the different ways in which they could be arranged.   Note that and are potentially two other ways of writing in . We could begin at any polygon and list the polygons in order. To avoid these repetitions, it is standard practice to begin with the polygon with the smallest number of sides and then move to its neighbor with the smallest number of sides, continuing around until all the polygons around the point have been named. Similarly, we write rather than for the tiling where the two squares are adjacent.    We are not including the three regular tilings in this list. There is one more vertex arrangement using five polygons (in addition to 3.3.4.3.4 and 3.3.3.4.4), five using four polygons, and eight more using three polygons (in addition to 3.7.42).    Some of the vertex arrangements in the previous task will extend to create a semiregular tiling, but not all of them! Experiment by surrounding one vertex using the pattern and then try to surround the neighboring vertices using the same arrangement. Which seem to work and which fail? For the ones that fail, what seems to go wrong?   Only eight of the seventeen possible vertex arrangements can be used to create a semiregular tiling.    What do you notice about the vertex arrangements that work (or those that don't work)? What do you wonder?   "

Upon completing this section, you should be able to explain to others how the Pythagorean Theorem follows from our basic principles. First, we introduce some terminology and refresh our memory on how to apply the theorem.    Right Triangles   triangle right  right triangle  hypotenuse  leg right triangle   As noted in , a right triangle is a triangle with one right angle. The longest side, called the hypotenuse , of a right triangle is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides of the right triangle are called the legs .     Check Your Understanding   Refer to the picture as you answer the following:   (for accessibility)     Which lowercase letter represents the hypotenuse in the triangle above?        Which angle appears to be the smallest in the triangle?        Which side appears to be the shortest in the triangle?      How are the answers to the last two questions related? Does this relationship also hold for the largest side and largest angle?   The smallest side is opposite the smallest angle. The largest side is opposite the largest angle.      The Pythagorean Theorem  The Pythagorean Theorem states that if and are the lengths of the sides of a right triangle and is the length of the hypotenuse, then .   Pythagorean Theorem   Suppose is a right triangle with right angle at . Let and be the lengths of legs and , respectively, and let be the length of the hypotenuse . Then .    The next set of questions will refresh your skill in using the Pythagorean Theorem to determine missing lengths.   Check your Understanding   A triangle has legs of length 5 and 7. Determine the length of the hypotenuse.        A square has a diagonal of length . Determine the length of the sides.   Since the sides of a square are the same length, use the same letter to represent all of them. How do you create a triangle from a square?          Proving the Pythagorean Theorem with Picture Puzzles  The Pythagorean Theorem is very useful, but it is also somewhat mysterious. Why does the formula work for all right triangles? Surprisingly, there are more than 350 recognized proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. We will look at just a few. In the following exploration, you will rearrange polygons built from a right triangle, and use the rearrangements to explain why in each case. You are encouraged to try all the proofs in this section and to choose one to learn well enough to convince others.   The book, The Pythagorean Proposition , by Elisha S. Loomis, (NCTM:1968) contains 367 proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem.     Puzzling over Why the Pythagorean Theorem Holds   For these explorations, we start with an arbitrary right triangle with hypotenuse length and legs of length and .   First Pythagorean Puzzle  In , the four blue triangles on the right are congruent copies of the right triangle . Check Puzzle_1 to reveal a second square. The side length of this new orange square is . To verify this, you can line up the side of the square with the hypotenuse of one of the triangles.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for .       Fill the square on the left using the four blue copies of the triangle and the orange square on the right. Pieces can be moved by selecting the interior and they can be rotated by moving the dotted vertex. The red triangle labeled is only shown for reference and will not be used. As always, there should be no gaps or overlaps. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas in terms of these variables.      Second Pythagorean Puzzle  For this puzzle, select Puzzle_2 in . The orange square should no longer be visible. Instead, a green square with side length , corresponding to the shorter leg of . The purple square below it has a side length corresponding to the other leg.    An interactive GeoGebra applet for .       Fill the square frame on the lower left with the four congruent right triangles and the squares with lengths and , respectively. Preserve your work with a sketch or screenshot.    What is the length of a side of the square that you filled? Give your answer in terms of lengths , , and\/or .    Determine the area of each of the pieces used to fill the square frame using the variables , , and\/or . Write the sum of these areas using variables.      Using the First Two Puzzles Together to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem  Look at the two ways in which you filled the square frames and the expressions for the area of the frames. How can you use this to justify the formula ?   An alternative is to use just the first puzzle and more algebra to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. This is acceptable, but Education majors may appreciate that the method of using both puzzles together can be used to convince third graders.    We could change the size and shape of the right triangle by moving any of the vertices , , or in the red triangle. Note that the sizes of the squares will also change according to the new lengths of the sides of the triangle. Will the length of each side of the black square frames still be expressed with the algebraic formula you indicated above? Can the new pieces be moved so that the new frame can be filled using the Puzzle 1 pieces and separately using the Puzzle 2 pieces? Give an algebraic argument for why the frame for Puzzle 1 and Puzzle 2 must be the same for any specified right triangle. Why does this allow us to set the two sums of areas equal to each other?   A Presidential Proof  This proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is attributed to James A. Garfield, the twentieth President of the United States. Refer to the diagram below:   Right triangle ABC with right angle at C. Point D is placed on ray CA so that the length of AD equals the length of BC. Point E is placed on the same side of CD as B so that line DE is perpendicular to AD and segment DE is the same length as AC. Points E and B are joined by a segment. This creates two congruent right triangles ABC and EAD and an isoceles right triangle BAE. The outer boundary is a trapezoid BCDE since BC and DE are parallel.      The diagram above consists of two congruent right triangles and one isosceles right triangle arranged to form a trapezoid. Label the hypotenuses with the letter . Label the smallest side of these triangles and the other leg . Note that the hypotenuse of the remaining right triangle is longer than . Instead, call its length to distinguish between the two numbers.    Identify the two parallel bases for the trapezoid. Determine the height of this trapezoid in terms of the labels you put on the diagram.    Compute the area of the trapezoid using the trapezoid formula leaving your answer in terms of the variables you used to label the diagram.    Similarly, compute the areas of each of the three triangular pieces and add them together.    How does this prove the Pythagorean Theorem?       The final proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is primarily visual. Almost no algebra is required.

How do you know that the two squares in your diagram are actually squares and that their side lengths are and , respectively? Base your argument on the lengths of the triangle sides.    How do these two sketches together show that the Pythagorean Theorem holds?         Reflecting on the Pythagorean Theorem  Most people can state the Pythagorean Theorem and use it to find missing lengths in a right triangle, but in this section you have learned why the theorem holds for all right triangles. We have practiced using variables in our arguments so that our explanation is not just shown for a right triangle with lengths 3, 4, and 5 (or 5, 12, and 13), but for all right triangles. Even so, the fact that we used puzzle pieces enables us to share this knowledge with anyone who has at least a fourth grade knowledge of geometry, area, and square numbers. A few of our proofs did not require the algebraic representation and symbolic manipulation learned in middle or high school.  On the other hand, we need to be careful that we do not try to apply this theorem to non-right triangles. It is possible to create a triangle whose side lengths are 3, 5, and 6, but this triangle will not have a right angle. In fact, the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem states that if , , and are sides of a triangle with , then the triangle will have a right angle opposite the side with length .     Exercises   Building Our Toolbox  Pythagorean Theorem  Write down the formula for the Pythagorean Theorem. Use an example and sketch as you explain when the theorem can be used, what the variables represent, and how to use the formula to solve a problem.   Principle of Additivity of Length     Use a picture to demonstrate why a segment formed by extending a segment of length units by a segment of more units produces a segment of length units.

First Pythagorean Puzzle  In , the four blue triangles on the right are congruent copies of the right triangle . Check Puzzle_1 to reveal a second square.

Pieces can be moved by selecting the interior and they can be rotated by moving the dotted vertex. The red triangle labeled is only shown for reference and will not be used.

Using the First Two Puzzles Together to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem  Look at the two ways in which you filled the square frames and the expressions for the area of the frames. How can you use this to justify the formula ?   An alternative is to use just the first puzzle and more algebra to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. This is acceptable, but Education majors may appreciate that the method of using both puzzles together can be used to convince third graders.    We could change the size and shape of the right triangle by moving any of the vertices , , or in the red triangle. Note that the sizes of the squares will also change according to the new lengths of the sides of the triangle. Will the length of each side of the black square frames still be expressed with the algebraic formula you indicated above? Can the new pieces be moved so that the new frame can be filled using the Puzzle 1 pieces and separately using the Puzzle 2 pieces? Give an algebraic argument for why the frame for Puzzle 1 and Puzzle 2 must be the same for any specified right triangle. Why does this allow us to set the two sums of areas equal to each other?   A Presidential Proof  This proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is attributed to James A. Garfield, the twentieth President of the United States. Refer to the diagram below:   Right triangle ABC with right angle at C. Point D is placed on ray CA so that the length of AD equals the length of BC. Point E is placed on the same side of CD as B so that line DE is perpendicular to AD and segment DE is the same length as AC. Points E and B are joined by a segment. This creates two congruent right triangles ABC and EAD and an isoceles right triangle BAE. The outer boundary is a trapezoid BCDE since BC and DE are parallel.      The diagram above consists of two congruent right triangles and one isosceles right triangle arranged to form a trapezoid. Label the hypotenuses with the letter . Label the smallest side of these triangles and the other leg . Note that the hypotenuse of the remaining right triangle is longer than . Instead, call its length to distinguish between the two numbers.    Identify the two parallel bases for the trapezoid. Determine the height of this trapezoid in terms of the labels you put on the diagram.    Compute the area of the trapezoid using the trapezoid formula leaving your answer in terms of the variables you used to label the diagram.    Similarly, compute the areas of each of the three triangular pieces and add them together.    How does this prove the Pythagorean Theorem?

Both of the solids in are polyhedra, but the one on the left is said to be concave since we can connect some vertices, like the far left and top vertex with straight segments that pass through the exterior (outside the surface) of the solid. As we work through this chapter, we will assume that a polyhedron is convex so that it has no valleys or depressions. Any line segment connecting two points on the surface of a convex polyhedron will only contain points on the surface or interior of the polyhedron.   A concave polyhedron and a convex polyhedron   A concave polyhedron and a convex polyhedron    A face of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two faces meet are called edges , and the points where edges meet are called the vertices of the polyhedron. The vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of its polygonal faces.  While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a side , one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms face and edge will make our discussions about polyhedra clearer.  Note also that a polyhedron has more than one type of angle. In this section, we will be working with angles whose rays are adjacent edges of the polyhedron. Each of these angles is a vertex angle of one of the faces of the polyhedron; hence, we may refer to them as face angles . This is not the same as a dihedral angle , measuring the space between two faces  face angle  angle of polyhedron face angle      Which of the following solids are polyhedra?   cylinder    cube    triangular prism   sphere     A cube and triangular prism are polyhedra. A cylinder and sphere are not polyhedra since they have curved surfaces.     Defining Regular Polyhedra  Just as with polygons and tilings, we describe some polyhedra as regular polyhedra . These special solids were identified by Greek mathematicians around 300 B.C., appear in ancient and modern art work, and are used to model chemical and biological structures today. In this section, we will find that only there are only a handful of polyhedra that meet the criteria of being regular.   regular polyhedron  polyhedron regular   A polyhedron is said to be regular if it satisfies these two conditions:   The faces are congruent regular polygons and    At every vertex, the number of polygons meeting is the same.         What Regular Polyhedra Exist   Discovering Regular Polyhedra  A nonregular polyhedron  Explain why a square pyramid, , is not a regular polyhedron.   Reread the definition for regular polyhedron.   Angle Measures at a Vertex    When we constructed tilings of the plane in , we found the sum of the measures of the angles surrounding a vertex was always the same. What was that sum?  Why must the total degree of the face angles surrounding a vertex be less than that amount if we are building a polyhedron instead of a tiling?     Look at some polyhedra or attempt to build some. Unless it has curved walls, your classroom is probably a polyhedra.   Regular Polyhedra with Triangular Faces  For this task, you will need copies of rigid congruent equilateral triangles that can be put together. There are commercially available shapes that can be snapped together, but you can also create your own using tagboard or even straws and string.   An online search for isometric graph paper will give you a sheet of congruent triangles that could be enlarged, printed on stiff paper, and cut. Equilateral triangles for building polyhedra may also be created from short straws and string. Perhaps, you have other ideas? Popsicle sticks? An edge length of at least 2 centimeters is recommended.   Which regular polyhedra can be formed using only equilateral triangles? To answer this question, we will consider the possible number of triangles that could meet at each vertex and attempt to construct the polyhedron, making sure that we keep the vertex arrangement consistent. Later you will be asked to enter the answers to some of these questions into .   What happens when you try to construct a polyhedron with only two triangles, and no other shapes, meeting at a vertex?    It is possible to create a regular polyhedron with exactly three triangles meeting at every vertex.   Build this polygon and describe its shape or save a picture of it.    How many triangular faces does this polyhedron have?    How many edges does this polyhedron have?    How many vertices does this polyhedron have?       It is also possible to create a polyhedron with exactly four triangles meeting at every vertex.   Build this polygon and describe its shape or save a picture of it. Check every vertex of the polyhedron to make sure there are exactly four triangles meeting.    How many triangular faces does this polyhedron have?    How many edges does this polyhedron have?    How many vertices does this polyhedron have?       Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron with exactly five triangles meeting at each vertex? If so, build it, record your work, count the faces, edges, and vertices.    What is the largest number of triangles that can meet at a vertex to form a corner or point of a polyhedron? What happens when you squeeze one more triangle in at a vertex?    Optional Extension: What happens when you squeeze yet another triangle in at each vertex ?    Use your answers above to complete the following table:      Regular Polyhedra with Triangular Faces    Number of faces at each vertex  Total number of faces  Total number of edges  Total number of vertices    3       4       5         A Nonregular Polyhedron made from Regular Triangles  There is a polyhedron that can be constructed which has exactly six faces, all being equilateral triangles. Build this polyhedron, and then explain why it does not satisfy the definition of a regular polyhedron.   Other Regular Polyhedra  We now explore whether we can form regular polyhedra using squares, regular pentagons, or other regular polygons.   Regular polyhedra with square faces:   Each angle of a square has what degree measure?    Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using only squares? If so, determine the number of squares that must meet at each vertex. Then construct or describe the polyhedron. Record a picture.   If you are making your own squares, you will need to ensure that every angle of each square is 90 degrees. Models made from straws may lose that property without proper support. On the other hand, you may have examples of a regular polyhedron with square faces already so that you do not need to build this.     If the construction is possible, count the faces at each vertex, the total number of faces, the total number of edges, and the total number of vertices. Record the information in below.    Would it be possible to create a regular polyhedron with fewer squares meeting at each vertex? Why or why not?    Would it be possible to create a regular polyhedron with more squares meeting at each vertex? Why or why not?       Regular polyhedra with pentagonal faces:   What is the measure of a vertex angle of a regular pentagon?    Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using only pentagons? If so, determine the number of regular pentagons that must meet at each vertex and then construct the polyhedron. Carefully describe this polyhedron and\/or save a picture.   Search for regular pentagon template to find a sheet of congruent regular pentagons that you can resize, print on sturdy paper, and cut.     If the construction was possible, count the faces at each vertex, the total number of faces, the total number of edges, and the total number of vertices. Record the information in below.    Is this the only possible regular polyhedron using pentagons? Explain.       In search of regular polyhedra whose faces have more than five sides:   What is the measure of each vertex angle in a regular hexagon?    Why will surrounding a vertex with three hexagons not result in a possible corner for a polyhedron?    If a regular polygon has more than six sides, then the measure of each of its vertex angles must be between what two numbers?    Write a thorough and convincing argument as to why any regular polyhedron must be bounded by equilateral triangles, squares, or regular pentagons. Conclude that there are exactly five types of regular polyhedra.

Let be the total number of faces, be the total number of edges, and be the total number of vertices. What do you notice about ?    We have determined that there are exactly five regular polyhedra. They have the names, tetrahedron (four-faced), hexahedron (six-faced), octahedron (eight-faced), dodecahedron (12-faced), and icosahedron (20-faced). Match these names to the polyhedra you created and add these labels to the appropriate lines in your tables.    Nets for Polyhedra  While building your polyhedra, you may have wondered whether it was necessary to cut out and glue each polygon separately. gives a triangle that can be cut out and folded along the interior lines to produce a regular tetrahedron. You may want to leave a little extra paper along some of the external edges so that you have a surface for gluing them together. This pattern is called a net for the polyhedron.   net polyhedron  polyhedral net   A net for a polyhedron is a single-piece pattern for the polyhedron that can be folded and glued to form the solid. A net can be created by cutting the polyhedron along some of its edges and unfolding. There are multiple nets for each polyhedron.     A net for a regular tetrahedron   The midpoints of the sides of an equilateral triangle are joined by segments to divide the triangle into four congruent equilateral triangles.      Exercises   Building your Toolbox   Give a definition of regular polyhedra in your own words. Then, name and describe each of the five regular polyhedra. In particular, you should mention the shape of each face and the number of faces meeting at each vertex.    Identify by name and\/or picture three examples of polyhedra that are not regular. Explain why each is not regular.    What must be true about the sum of the angle measures at any vertex of a convex polyhedron?     Skills and Recall  Tetrahedral Nets  Two patterns are given in . Which, if any, will form a regular tetrahedron when folded along the provided lines?   Possible tetrahedral nets   Pattern a gives a string of four equilateral triangles arranged in a line. The fold lines zigzag down the interior of the design. Pattern b gives four equilateral triangles which share a common vertex.

Not regular polyhedral nets   Pattern a has six squares. Four are in a row and there is one below the first and the last. Pattern b has three squares in a row and two equilateral triangles, one each along the top edge of the center square and along the bottom edge of the center square. Pattern c is a strip of six alternating regular triangles. Pattern d has four 1.3x2 rectangles and two 1.3x1.3 squares.       Extending the Concepts  Counting Vertices and Edges  It is easy to lose track when counting the vertices or edges of a polyhedron with many faces. We can use mathematical reasoning to compute these values for regular polyhedra.   Knowing that an octahedron consists of eight triangular faces, we can count vertices and edges before octahedron is assembled.   Every edge gets glued to one edge of another triangle so the assembled octahedron will have half as many edges. How many edges does the octahedron have?    How many triangles meet at each vertex of an octahedron?    Divide the total number, 24, of vertices of the triangles by the number of triangles that meet at each vertex of the octahedron. This will give you the number of vertices in the assembled octahedron.       Use a similar argument to compute the number of edges and vertices in an icosahedron.    Use a similar argument to compute the number of edges and vertices in a dodecahedron.         "

Both of the solids in are polyhedra, but the one on the left is said to be concave since we can connect some vertices, like the far left and top vertex with straight segments that pass through the exterior (outside the surface) of the solid. As we work through this chapter, we will assume that a polyhedron is convex so that it has no valleys or depressions. Any line segment connecting two points on the surface of a convex polyhedron will only contain points on the surface or interior of the polyhedron.   A concave polyhedron and a convex polyhedron   A concave polyhedron and a convex polyhedron    A face of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two faces meet are called edges , and the points where edges meet are called the vertices of the polyhedron. The vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of its polygonal faces.  While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a side , one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms face and edge will make our discussions about polyhedra clearer.  Note also that a polyhedron has more than one type of angle. In this section, we will be working with angles whose rays are adjacent edges of the polyhedron. Each of these angles is a vertex angle of one of the faces of the polyhedron; hence, we may refer to them as face angles .

Angle Measures at a Vertex    When we constructed tilings of the plane in , we found the sum of the measures of the angles surrounding a vertex was always the same. What was that sum?  Why must the total degree of the face angles surrounding a vertex be less than that amount if we are building a polyhedron instead of a tiling?     Look at some polyhedra or attempt to build some. Unless it has curved walls, your classroom is probably a polyhedra.   Regular Polyhedra with Triangular Faces  For this task, you will need copies of rigid congruent equilateral triangles that can be put together. There are commercially available shapes that can be snapped together, but you can also create your own using tagboard or even straws and string.   An online search for isometric graph paper will give you a sheet of congruent triangles that could be enlarged, printed on stiff paper, and cut. Equilateral triangles for building polyhedra may also be created from short straws and string. Perhaps, you have other ideas? Popsicle sticks? An edge length of at least 2 centimeters is recommended.   Which regular polyhedra can be formed using only equilateral triangles? To answer this question, we will consider the possible number of triangles that could meet at each vertex and attempt to construct the polyhedron, making sure that we keep the vertex arrangement consistent. Later you will be asked to enter the answers to some of these questions into .   What happens when you try to construct a polyhedron with only two triangles, and no other shapes, meeting at a vertex?    It is possible to create a regular polyhedron with exactly three triangles meeting at every vertex.   Build this polygon and describe its shape or save a picture of it.    How many triangular faces does this polyhedron have?    How many edges does this polyhedron have?    How many vertices does this polyhedron have?       It is also possible to create a polyhedron with exactly four triangles meeting at every vertex.   Build this polygon and describe its shape or save a picture of it. Check every vertex of the polyhedron to make sure there are exactly four triangles meeting.    How many triangular faces does this polyhedron have?    How many edges does this polyhedron have?    How many vertices does this polyhedron have?       Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron with exactly five triangles meeting at each vertex? If so, build it, record your work, count the faces, edges, and vertices.    What is the largest number of triangles that can meet at a vertex to form a corner or point of a polyhedron? What happens when you squeeze one more triangle in at a vertex?    Optional Extension: What happens when you squeeze yet another triangle in at each vertex ?

Build this polyhedron, and then explain why it does not satisfy the definition of a regular polyhedron.   Other Regular Polyhedra  We now explore whether we can form regular polyhedra using squares, regular pentagons, or other regular polygons.   Regular polyhedra with square faces:   Each angle of a square has what degree measure?    Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using only squares? If so, determine the number of squares that must meet at each vertex. Then construct or describe the polyhedron. Record a picture.   If you are making your own squares, you will need to ensure that every angle of each square is 90 degrees. Models made from straws may lose that property without proper support. On the other hand, you may have examples of a regular polyhedron with square faces already so that you do not need to build this.     If the construction is possible, count the faces at each vertex, the total number of faces, the total number of edges, and the total number of vertices. Record the information in below.    Would it be possible to create a regular polyhedron with fewer squares meeting at each vertex? Why or why not?    Would it be possible to create a regular polyhedron with more squares meeting at each vertex? Why or why not?       Regular polyhedra with pentagonal faces:   What is the measure of a vertex angle of a regular pentagon?    Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using only pentagons? If so, determine the number of regular pentagons that must meet at each vertex and then construct the polyhedron. Carefully describe this polyhedron and\/or save a picture.   Search for regular pentagon template to find a sheet of congruent regular pentagons that you can resize, print on sturdy paper, and cut.     If the construction was possible, count the faces at each vertex, the total number of faces, the total number of edges, and the total number of vertices. Record the information in below.    Is this the only possible regular polyhedron using pentagons? Explain.       In search of regular polyhedra whose faces have more than five sides:   What is the measure of each vertex angle in a regular hexagon?    Why will surrounding a vertex with three hexagons not result in a possible corner for a polyhedron?    If a regular polygon has more than six sides, then the measure of each of its vertex angles must be between what two numbers?    Write a thorough and convincing argument as to why any regular polyhedron must be bounded by equilateral triangles, squares, or regular pentagons.

  "body": " Prisms and Cylinders   Definitions  We now explore the geometric solid known as a prism in greater detail. As noted in , a prism is a box-like geometric solid with a pair of congruent and parallel polygonal faces, called the base and the summit, joined by a band of parallelograms. The number of parallelograms connecting the bases will always equal the number of sides of each base.  We are most familiar with right prisms , namely prisms where the bases meet all the side faces at right angles; the side faces of a right prism are rectangles. An oblique prism , on the other hand, will have parallelograms other than rectangles as its side faces. right prism  oblique prism  prism oblique  prism right    Right and Oblique Prisms    Right Prism   A rectangular box.     Oblique Prism      A cylinder is not a polyhedron since it has circular bases; however, there are some important similarities between prisms and cylinders. Both have parallel, congruent bases.   Right and Oblique Cylinders    Right Cylinder   A cylinder or can.     Oblique Cylinder   A can that is oblique.      Check your understanding  Besides the parallel circles, what other shape(s) is needed to form the surface of a right cylinder? How many of these shapes are there?   Cut two circles out of paper to cover a cylindrical can. What else do you need to cover the exposed surface?   The two circles are joined by a single rectangle. The width of this rectangle equals the circumference of a circular end.   An important measurement for prisms and cylinders is the distance between the bases. Many geometry textbooks use the term height to describe this distance.   height prism  stretch   The height of a prism or cylinder is the distance between the parallel congruent bases and is measured along a line perpendicular to the bases. When a prism or cylinder is sitting on a side other than a base, the height will be measured laterally instead of vertically. In this text, the word stretch will be used in lieu of height to clarify which dimension is being discussed.  The stretch (or height) of a right prism is usually measured along an edge of one of the rectangular sides, like in . On the other hand, the stretch of a skew prism, such as the one illustrated in , will be less than the height of a side face. Similarly, the stretch of a cylinder is also measured at a right angle to the base as indicated by in .      Volumes of Prisms and Cylinders  In this exploration, we develop learn how to measure the space inside of a prism or pyramid. Hopefully, exploring the meaning of volume will help you appreciate and remember how to find volume.   Understanding Volume   Suppose you have a box (right rectangular prism) that has a height (or stretch) of 6 inches, a length of 5 inches, and a width of 7 inches and you have a large supply of -cubes.   If you cover the bottom of the inside of the box with a single layer of -cubes, how many cubes will fit in this first layer?    How many horizontal layers of -cubes could you fit in the box? Would each of these layers contain the same number of cubes as the first layer?    What is the total number of 1”x1”x1”-cubes that could fit in the box?       Explain why the formula for the volume of a rectangular box is where is the height, is the width, and is the height of the box.    When is a whole number, it makes sense to think about the height as the number of layers. Not all measurements are whole numbers though. Instead we can think of as the amount that we need to stretch that first layer to reach the summit of the prism. Consider the rectangular prism in with base dimensions, inches and inches, and a stretch of inches. Find the volume of the prism.   Here you may be imagining two layers with a half layer on top of them. The half cubes ( -cubes on the top layer can be paired to create full -cubes.    A prism with dimensions 5x6x2.5.   A prism.      This notion of stretching the bottom layer holds for all prisms and cylinders, not just rectangular ones. Suppose a cylinder has a circular base with area 9.4 square centimeters. If the cylinder is one centimeter tall, we will say that the volume is cubic centimeters.  If the cylinder is two centimeters tall, how should the volume compare to that of the one-centimeter-tall cylinder with the same base? What is the volume?   If the cylinder is three centimeters tall, what is the volume?   If the cylinder is five centimeters tall, what is the volume?  If the cylinder is 7.5 centimeters tall, what is the volume?  If the cylinder is centimeters tall, what is volume?      Exploration showed that the the volume of a prism or cylinder was equal to the area of the base times the number of horizontal layers. Although you may be familiar with the formula , it is preferable to have a single formula that allows us to compute the volume of all prisms, not just rectangular prisms. Note that the formula is equivalent to the formula where is the area of one base of a rectangular prism and is the distance (or stretch) between the bases, measured perpendicular to the bases. This volume formula will extend to all prisms and even cylinders! Much less to memorize! To find the volume of any prism or cylinder, whether right or oblique, we need only compute the area of the base and then multiply this area by the stretch between the bases.   Finding the Volume of Prisms and Cylinders   Use the formula to determine the volume of the right prism with an isosceles triangle base.   Isosceles triangle right prism   Prism with isosceles triangle bases. Triangles have base 12 feet and height 14 feet. Distance between the bases is 18 feet.      Show all work as you compute the following measurements for the oblique cylinder in . Formulas for the area and circumference of a circle are given in .   The stretch .    The area of a circular base.    The volume of the cylinder.      Oblique cylinder   An oblique cylinder with radius 4 mm and slant height 24 mm. A right triangle is also drawn with the slant of the cylinder being the hypotenuse and cylinder's altitude of unknown length d, corresponding to one leg. The remaining leg is 9 mm long.     The answers in (b) involve irrational numbers, namely a square root and . Your answer to (c) will be more accurate if you use the actual square root and , not their estimates, in your calculation of volume. If you do use estimates, include at least four digits after the decimal point when inputting the values into part (c).   (c) 1118.3 cu. mm.   (a) ; (b) ; (c)     Create a formula for the volume a cylinder with height where the radius of each circular base is . Your formula should contain the variables and . Then check that your formula give the same result as you found in .      The Surface Area of Prisms and Cylinders  While the volume measures the amount of interior space of a 3-dimensional solid, the surface area measures the amount of material needed to create the shell or surface of the solid. To compute surface area, we simply compute the area of each face and add the areas together. surface area    Finding the Surface Area of Prisms and Cylinders   The triangular prism in has five faces. Determine the area of each face and then compute the surface area.    The right cylinder in has a height of 20 feet and a diameter of 10 ft.   Determine the area of each circular base.    With the circular ends removed, the cylinder looks like a tube, perhaps the cardboard center of a paper towel or toilet paper roll. If we cut this tube lengthwise Here, lengthwise means a long a line perpendicular to an edge. and flatten it out, what shape do we get?    To determine the area of this flattened surface, we will need to determine its dimensions. One of these dimensions will be the length of the once-circular edge. What is the other dimension?    To find the length of the once-circular edge, we note that this edge was the circumference of the circular base. Determine this length. Then determine the area of the flattened surface.    Add the areas of the three surfaces of the cylinder, namely the two circular bases and the flattened tube, to compute the surface area of the cylinder.      A right cylinder   Right cylinder with height 20 feet and diameter 10 ft.      Create a general formula for a right cylinder with height where the radius of each circular base is given by the variable . Your formula should contain the variables and . Then check that your formula gives the same result as you found in for the surface area of the cylinder in .

Pyramid  pyramid  apex pyramid  height pyramid   A pyramid is a polyhedron which may have any polygon as its base but the all remaining faces are triangles that come together at a common vertex called the apex . The height of the pyramid is measured from the apex to the plane containing the base along a line perpendicular to this plane.  We name each pyramid according to its base. Thus, a triangular pyramid has a triangular base, a square pyramid has a square base, and so forth. Also, the apex of the pyramid need not be directly above the center of the base; in fact, the apex may not be directly above any part of the pyramid.

Measuring Pyramids  In , we shall compute measurements for a specific example, a pyramid with a rectangular base and three perpendicular edges meeting at vertex . If this exploration is done in class, your instructor may choose to assign different pyramids to different groups. If this is the case, you will want to construct your pyramid very carefully so that your pyramid can be assembled with other groups' pyramids to form a new, yet familiar, solid. Then we will be able to use this construction to compute volume.   Exploring a Rectangular Pyramid   In this activity, you will study the rectangular pyramid that is created by folding only one of the nets in . Check with your instructor to see which net you should explore.    Nets of three rectangular pyramids     Pyramid Net 1   A net that can be folded to create a rectangular pyramid with 3 by 4 rectangular base and height 5.     Pyramid Net 2   A net that can be folded to create a rectangular pyramid with 3 by 5 rectangular base and height 4.     Pyramid Net 3   A net that can be folded to create a rectangular pyramid with 4 by 5 rectangular base and height 3.        Finding Edge Lengths and Surface Area  Regardless of which Pyramid Net you are working wih, is a rectangle. The pyramid formed by Pyramid Net 1 , has a -rectangular base, the one formed by Pyramid Net 2 a -rectangular base, and the one formed by Pyramid Net 3 has a -rectangular base. Angles , , , and are right angles and the length of is the remaining value of 5, 4, or 3 as indicated on the sketch.

What do you notice about the corner of your pyramid at ?     Surface Area of Pyramids and Cones  With both prisms and pyramids, formulas exist to compute the surface area of some of the common types, but these formulas are often not necessary. The tough part of computing surface area is determining missing lengths and altitudes. Some formulas will alleviate the need to perform these computations. Some of these formulas use techniques that are beyond the scope of this course. However, if we can compute the area of each face, then the surface area is simply the sum of the areas of the faces. Working with nets can help us focus on measuring the surfaces.  As illustrated in , the surface of a cone will consist of two parts, the circle that forms its base and a circular sector that forms the section connecting the apex to the base. In the net for the cone, the center of the circular sector corresponds to the apex of the cone and the radius of the sector corresponds to the slant height of the cone. This slant height is measured along a line segment from the apex to the edge of the base which meets the base at an angle less than 90 degrees.   The cone, pictured in , has a circular base with radius 3 and a vertical height of 6. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that the slant height is . The net for this cone consists of the radius-3 circular base and the shaded portion of the larger circle. The fact that the circumference of the base matches the curved edge of the sector enables us to find the central angle, approximately of the sector. The process of finding the angle and area of the sector is left to an exercise.   A cone and its net.   Cone with base radius 3, vertical height 6, and slant length 6.71. Two touching circles, one with radius 3. The other with radius 6.71 has shaded portion with central angle 161.      Volume of Pyramids and Cones  We end this section by stating a fact that will allow us to find the volume of many pyramids and cones.   Volume of a Pyramid and Cone  volume pyramid  volume cone  cone volume  pyramid volume   The volume of a pyramid is one-third the volume of a prism with the same base and height. Thus, the volume of a pyramid is given by where is the area of the base and is the height measured along a vertical line segment from the apex to the base.  Similarly the volume of a cone is one third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. Since the base of a cone or cylinder is a circle with area, , the formula for the volume of a cone can be written as where is the radius of the base and h is the vertical height when the cone is sitting on its base.    This fact may be something you choose to accept and use without further justification, but in case you have doubts, the remainder of this section provides several different ways to visualize this surprising fact. As you have already experienced, visualizing three-dimensional properties can be challenging. Use the activities or videos, that work best for you or is required by your instructor.   Visualizing Pyramid and Cone Volume with Water   This is the simplest demonstration of the claim that the volume of a pyramid is one-third the volume of the corresponding prism, but to perform this task, a special set of containers are needed. These are available through educational material companies. This exploration can also be viewed in the YouTube video in .    Typically, this set will contain two pyramids and prisms with the same base and height and one cone and cylinder with the same base and height. Fill the pyramid (or cone) with water and then pour the water into the prism (or cylinder) that has the same base and height. Repeat until the prism (or cylinder) is filled. What do you notice?    Repeat the previous experiment with any other pyramid\/prism or cone\/cylinder pairs you have available.    Does this prove that the formula works in all cases where a pyramid (or cone) has the same base and height as a prism (or cylinder)? What are some nice properties that the paired solids you used have that other prisms and pyramid pairs might not have? What are some other pyramid\/prism pairs or cone\/cylinder pairs that you would add to the set to make the argument more convincing?    YouTube using water to compare volumes This video, compiled by Mr. Chauny, contains snips of three other videos as noted in his credits.       Visualizing the Volume of a Rectangular Pyramid By Construction from Nets   This demonstration of the volume formula for a pyramid uses the three nets created in . Because the nets are constructed using paper and tape, the ability to complete and comprehend this demonstration may depend on the quality of construction. It is essential that the scale of the three pyramids is consistent. The document bit.ly\/3PyramidNets displays all three nets with the same scale. Printing on stiffer tagboard is recommended.    Cut out each net and carefully assemble each into a pyramid with base .    Arrange the three pyramids so that the form a single rectangular prism. The faces will be -, -, and -rectangles.    Compute the volume of the prism.    Each of the three pyramids has a different base. Determine the area of the base of the pyramid formed by folding   Pyramid Net 1    Pyramid Net 2    Pyramid Net 3       Use the formula to compute the volume of the pyramid formed by   Pyramid Net 1    Pyramid Net 2    Pyramid Net 3       How does additivity of volume together with the computations in and help to confirm the formula for the volume of pyramid for this particular situation?  Bonus challenge: To what family of pyramids can we generalize this argument   For the bonus, note that these pyramids had a particular shaped base and a special base angle.     Visualizing the Volume of a Rectangular Pyramid using a Geogebra Applet   In this demonstration of the relationship between the volume formulas of prisms and pyramids, this GeoGebra applet, created Golden, John, \"Pyramids in Prism,\" GeoGebra Public Resources, CC-BY-SA, 2015. Slightly edited to delete questions and adjust the graphical views. by John Golden, demonstrates how a -rectangular prism into three rectangular pyramids. In this activity, the shapes are the same as in , but the prism is pulled apart rather than built. The applet allows us to change the dimensions of the prism and pyramids to help us see that the formula holds for prisms of other dimensions as well. A device with a larger screen is recommended.    Use the GeoGebra interactive to complete the tasks. Note that right angles and other features are often distorted when we view three-dimensional figures on paper or computer screen.   Verify that the blue rectangle shown on the left has the same dimensions as the base of the prism on the right. Do this by checking the coordinates on the graph.   Drag point , the lower right corner of the rectangle in the left picture. What happens to the prism on the right?    Drag point , the upper left corner of the rectangle in the left picture. How does this affect the prism on the right?      Move the vertical slider on the far left to change the value of . How does this affect the prism on the right?   Use the reset button (upper right corner of the left frame) to return the value of and the locations of and to their original setting.  Slowly move the top slider to pull the prism apart into pyramids, observing the process in the right frame.   When the slider is moved all the way to the right, there should be three pyramids visible in the right frame and three rectangles visible in the left frame.   Verify that the three rectangles on the left correspond to the bases of the three pyramids on the right. You may need to adjust your viewing window by zooming out or dragging. You can also see the coordinates of the vertices by right-clicking on the point. HOW DOES THIS WORK ON A MAC?   What are the dimensions of the base of the green prism, given by ?    What are the dimensions of the base of the red prism, given by ?          GeoGebra interactive to disassemble a prism into pyramids        These explorations show that, at least in a few cases, the volume of a pyramid or cone is one-third that of the corresponding prism or cylinder. A proof of this fact for all situations is beyond the scope of this course.     Exercises   Skills and Recall   Determine the volumes of the following solids:   A pyramid with a square base and a height of .   V=108 cubic units.       A pyramid with a rectangular base with a length of , a width of , and a height of .   35 cubic units       A cone with height 15 cm and radius 10 cm.    cm^{2}    cubic centimeters   A triangular pyramid with a distance of 10 cm from apex to base. The base is an isosceles triangle with sides 13 cm, 13 cm, and 10 cm. Since the base is isosceles, its altitude passes through the midpoint of the 10 cm side. This pyramid is sketched in and the lengths of the sides of the base are given.   Isosceles pyramid with 10-13-13 base and height 10   Triangular Pyramid with 10-13-13 base and height 10     Determine the surface area of the solids:   The prism with an isosceles triangle base and stretch distance 10 cm where the triangle has one side of length 10 cm and two of length 13 cm.   Net for isosceles triangle prism   Net for a prism with 10-13-13 isosceles triangle base and stretch distance 10.    480       The pyramid with net given in      Net for a pyramid with 10-13-13 isosceles triangle base and stretch distance 10    275.58       The prism in and the pyramid in have the same height and base. Divide the two surface areas. Does there appear to be a nice relationship between the surface area of a pyramid and the surface area of the associated prism?   Make sure that your calculator is showing four or more digits after the decimal point. Is the ratio you compute a nice number or an ugly number? Is it familiar to you?   The ratio is 1.74178097104. There does not appear to be a nice relationship between the two surface areas.  In fact, the surface area due to the base(s) will be related by a factor of two since there are two bases in a prism and one in a pyramid. However, the heights of the triangular sides are not the same as the stretch distance of the prism, but instead are where is the distance from the centroid of the base to the edge joining the base to the face.     Extending the Concepts  Angle and Area of a Sector  The questions in this exercise refer to the cone in which has a circular base with radius 8 inches and a slant height of 17 inches.   Determine the area of the base of this cone.   Use the fact that the height of the cone is measured from the apex along a segment perpendicular to the base to determine the height of this cone.   Determine the volume of this cone.   A cone with radius 8 and slant height 17   A cone with radius 8 and slant height 17    Determine the circumference of the base.   The base is a circle with radius 8. What is the formula for the circumference? Also, if you leave the constant in your answer, it will simplify your work in a later problem.           A possible net for the cone is given in . The distance from to along the circular arc, known as the arclength , should equal the distance around the circumference of the base.   What is the total circumference of a circle with radius 17 inches?   Again, you are encouraged to leave the number in your answer.   What fraction of this circumference should the arclength from to be?   The number should cancel, leaving you with a fraction where the numerator and denominator are whole numbers. Do they look familiar?   What is the rotational angle of a full circle? Use this together with the fraction you just computed to determine the measure of .   This figure only shows a rough approximation of the location of . Do not use a protractor.   Determine the area of the sector of circle from to .   Determine the surface area of the cone with radius 8 inches and slant height 17 inches.   What did you learn by doing this exercise? Did you observe anything that you think would make a good conjecture for cones in general?   Net for the cone with slant height 17 and radius 8   A circle with radius 8 and a sector of a circle with radius 17.       "

Typically, this set will contain two pyramids and prisms with the same base and height and one cone and cylinder with the same base and height. Fill the pyramid (or cone) with water and then pour the water into the prism (or cylinder) that has the same base and height. Repeat until the prism (or cylinder) is filled. What do you notice?    Repeat the previous experiment with any other pyramid\/prism or cone\/cylinder pairs you have available.    Does this prove that the formula works in all cases where a pyramid (or cone) has the same base and height as a prism (or cylinder)?

  "title": "Orientation-Maintaining Isometries",
  "body": " Orientation-Maintaining Isometries   What do we mean by orientation-maintaining?  The picture shows a triangle reflected across a line . Although the letters , , and are in alphabetical order when read clockwise from the original figure, the letters in the reflected image are in the reverse order. When this happens, we say that the transformation reverses orientation . Any reflection will be an orientation-reversing transformation.   A reflection reverses orientation   Triangle ABC reflected across a line m to create triangle C'B'A'.    Not all transformations change orientation. In this section, you will encounter two types of orientation-maintaining transformations, namely rotations and translations. When an orientation-maintaining transformation is performed, the order in which the vertices are read is unchanged.   Many textbooks use orientation-reversing and orientation-preserving . Because of similarity in the words, reversing and preserving, I have chosen to use the term orientation-maintaining instead of orientation-preserving.    orientation  change orientation  reverse orientation  preserve orientation  maintain orientation  same orientation   A geometrical transformation is said to maintain orientation if when it acts on any polygon the order of the vertices of the resulting image, read in clockwise order, are the same as that of the original figure. Another term for orientation-maintaining is orientation-preserving .  On the other hand, if the resulting images have the vertices in the reverse order, we say that the transformation reverses orientation .      Collinearities and Isomorphisms  We observed that although reflections reverse orientation, they preserve distance, angle measure, and shape; any object and its image under a reflection are congruent. In , we see the action of the reflection across line not just on triangle , but on other points on the plane. Note how points and lie on and their reflected images and lie on the image of . This suggests that this reflection, and in fact any reflection, should preserve linearity of points.   Action of a Reflection      A transformation that preserves linearity, that takes collinear points to collinear points, is called a collineation . preserves linearity  collineation      directs our attention to some qualities preserved by a reflection. As you encounter other collineations you are encouraged to check whether these properties continue to hold.   Properties Preserved by a Reflection   Give examples in that illustrate each of the following properties preserved by the reflection. In some cases, there may be more than one answer.   A point in the interior of a polygon maps to a point in the interior of the image of the polygon.    A point in the exterior of a polygon maps to a point in the exterior of the image of the polygon.    If a point is between two other points on a line, then its image will also lie between the images of those two points.    Points on the right side of the mirror will reflect to a point on the left side of the mirror.    Distance between points is preserved.    Angle measure is preserved.    The image of a point maps reflects back to the original point.       Let be the point where lines and intersect. Where must , the image of be located? Why?    The transformation in is a collineation, but it does not preserve distance. For the remainder of we will focus on distance-preserving collineations. Collineations that do not preserve distance will be the focus of .   isomorphism  distance-preserving  collineation distance-preserving   A collineation is called an isomorphism if it preserves distance between points. In other words, is an isomorphism if for every two points and , where and .    Reflections are just one example of an isomorphism. We shall see that translations and rotations also preserve linearity and distance.    Translations  The first orientation-maintaining transformation is called a translation or slide .   translation  vector  translation vector   A translation is an transformation that slides every point on the plane a fixed distance in a specified direction. The direction and distance are often given in the form of a directed line segment called the translation vector .     Translating on a Coordinate Plane   This exploration may also be done on paper using a print copy of instead of the application.     gives a picture of quadrilateral a vector on a coordinate grid. Vector goes from to suggesting that this translation moves points three units to the right and one unit down.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for translating by a coordinate vector.       Use the point tool to locate and mark the image created by moving point by vector . What are the coordinates of ?   GeoGebra will assign a new name, perhaps , to the point you create. If you would like to rename it, right click on the point and select rename.     Create , , and in a similar fashion, recording their coordinates. Then use the polygon tool to draw quadrilateral .       Does the transformation mapping to preserve distance? In other words, is the length of each side of quadrilateral equal to its corresponding side in quadrilateral ?    Are the corresponding angles of and congruent?    Is the orientation of quadrilateral maintained under the translation? How do you know?    Sketch the segments , , , and .   What do you notice about the lengths of these segments?    What appears to be true about the lines , , , and ?      Since lines have infinite length, you should be looking for a property other than length.    Are the quadrilaterals and congruent?   What type of quadrilateral is ? How do you know? Can the same be said of quadrilaterals , , and ?   An isometry affects all points in the plane, not just those pictured. Draw three new points: point lying on side , point lying in the exterior of quadrilateral , and point lying in the interior of .   Sketch point , the image of under the transformation that takes to . How is the location of related to ?    Sketch point , the image of under the transformation that takes to . How is the location of related to ?    Sketch point the image of under the transformation that takes to . How is the location of related to ?       We call the isometry in a translation . Describe in your own words how a translation acts on points in the plane.     Properties of Translations  In , we observed many of the properties of a transformation called a translation . translation Each translation is uniquely defined by a translation vector A vector is simply a directed line segment between two points. which indicates the direction and distance that every point is moved by the translation. The choice of the translation vector, on the other hand, is not unique. Any vector of the same length which points in the same direction may serve as the vector for the translation. In , the vector is a translation vector for the given translation; however, , , , or even your would describe the same translation. Any of these vectors may be chosen as the translation vector for this translation. You probably noticed that these vectors were parallel and had the same length.     Rotations   The third transformation we will consider is a rotation . Like a translation, a rotation maintains the orientation of the vertices. As the name suggests, a rotation spins the points of a plane around a single fixed point.   rotation  center of a rotation  angle of rotation   A rotation is a transformation of points on a plane that has a single point, called the center of the rotation, which is not moved by the rotation. All other points are rotated around the center a specific number of degrees. This specified number of degrees is referred to as the angle of rotation .    Note that we also need to specify the direction of the spin. If the direction of a rotation is not specified, we will assume that it spins in the counter-clockwise direction. To indicate a clockwise rotation, the angle may be given as a negative number.    Exploring a Rotation    shows an example of the action of a translation on triangle . Use this figure to answer the following:   A rotation of   Triangle ABC is rotated around a point F to form triangle A'B'C'.      List the vertices of the original triangle clockwise order starting with . List the vertices of the image in clockwise order starting with . Does the rotation maintain the orientation of the triangle?    What point in is the center of this particular rotation? Is it on either triangle, in the interior of either triangle, or in the exterior of both triangles? How do you know that the point you identified as the center meets the criteria in the definition of center of rotation ?    Is the rotation distance-preserving? How do you know?    In , the following angle measures are given: Determine the following angle measures:                     What is the degree measure of the rotational angle of this rotation? Is it a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation?     Properties of Rotations  A rotation is specified by two pieces of information, namely its center and the angle of rotation. The center is the one point which does not move. Each other point is moved to a new point . The distance between the center and each point does not change under the rotation, but the direction from the center to each point is changed according to the rotation angle.  The angle of rotation is given by the angle where is the center of the rotation. A positive rotation moves each point to its image in the counterclockwise direction. On the other hand, a rotational angle with negative degree measure would move the image clockwise around the center. Rotational angles may be greater than 180 degrees or negative; in fact, any number of degrees is allowed!  Check your understanding  What is the degree measure of the rotational angle of a clockwise rotation that is identical to a 123-degree counterclockwise rotation? Give two answers, one that is a negative number and other a positive number.      "

  "title": "Identifying Isometries",
  "body": " Identifying Isometries   What do we know? What do we wonder?   As we continue to build on our knowledge of isometries, it is wise to summarize what we know so far. We know that a transformation of a plane is a mapping or function that sends each point on the plane to a unique point called its image under the transformation. Some transformations are collineations , meaning that if a set of points all lie on the same line, then their images will also lie on a single line. We have observed that some collineations preserve shape and angle measure and that some collineations that preserve angle measure will also preserve distance. The transformations that preserve all of these, collinearity, angle measure, and distance, are called isometries .    Reflect and Wonder   Before reading this section, respond to the following questions. There are no right or wrong answers!   Write down three things you know about transformations, especially the three isometries we have looked at, namely reflections, translations, and rotations.    Is there anything that was discussed in the first sections on transformations that you need clarity on?    What do you wonder about transformations? What questions remain?         Isometry Between Congruent Figures  We are familiar with three types of isometries: reflections, translations, and rotations. Yet many questions remain: Are there other types of isometries? Are there transformations that are not isometries? If two figures are congruent, is there always an isometry mapping one to the other? If so, how do we determine what type of isometry it is?  Although we have not proved this fact, it is true that if we have two congruent figures, there will be an isometry that maps one onto the other. Our goal in this section and next will be to identify the type of isometry that takes one figure onto a congruent copy. Is it a reflection, a translation, a rotation, or something else? Then having determined the type can we specify the exact action that performs the movement. A good place to start is to identify whether the isometry maintains orientation.  Distinguishing Between Types of Isometries by Orientation     Imagine that is a moveable cutout triangle with a beach scene on the front face and gray cardboard on the back. We can think of the action of an isometry as moving so that it aligns perfectly with its image . Which isometries--reflections, translations, and rotations-- studied so far will keep beach side up? Which will turn over so that it is cardboard side up? What property is this related to?    How might you tell the difference between a translation and a rotation? Assume that you are given a picture of two congruent triangles and where the orientation is the same. How do you know whether a translation takes to ? How do you know whether the isometry is a rotation? Could it be both? or neither?        Recognizing Isometries by Fixed Points  Another way to distinguish between isometries is to note which points, if any, are unmoved by the isometry. Such a point is called a fixed point of the isometry. If is a fixed point of isometry , then . Following our convention of calling the image of point by the symbol , is a fixed point if . fixed point    Determining the Fixed Points of an Isometry   In , which point(s) are not moved by the reflection across ? Are there unlabeled points that are also fixed by this reflection? Explain.    In , which point(s) are not moved by the rotation about point ? Are there any unlabeled points that are also fixed by this reflection? Explain.    In , which point(s) are not moved by the translation by vector ? Are there any unlabeled points that are fixed by this translation? Explain.     Like the function you may have encountered in another course, there is a transformation of the plane that maps every point to itself. We call this transformation, the identity transformation . Under the action of the identity transformation, every point is a fixed point. Clearly, the identity function also preserves distance, angle measure, and orientation since it leaves everything unchanged. identity transformation      Defining Objects of Isometries  Once we determine whether the isometry mapping one figure onto a congruent image is a reflection, translation, or rotation, we need to specify which reflection, which translation, or which rotation it is. We do this by identifying the defining object(s) of the isometry. With a reflection, for example, we should specify which line we are reflecting across. lists the defining objects for the three isometries we have studied.   Defining Objects for Three Isometries         Isometry  Defining Objects    Reflection  Reflecting Line (or mirror)    Translation  Translation Vector    Rotation  Center and Rotational Angle     How do we find the mirror for a reflection? the vector for a translation? the center and angle for an rotation? Although the defining objects determine how the isometry acts on all points in the plane, we need just a few points along with their images in order to find the defining objects. As you work through make note of these methods and add them to your toolbox.   Finding Defining Objects of Isometries   For each isometry, we will observe some properties of the isometry and defining object(s) and then use these properties to locate the defining object(s).   Finding the Mirror of a Reflection     Refer to which shows a reflection of across line , how is the reflecting line related to each segment connecting a vertex of the triangle to its image?    Click on the tools available in the top menu of the following interactive. Then sketch the reflecting line for the isometry that takes to using the tools you think would enable you to determine the exact reflecting line. Do not use guess and check.   An interactive GeoGebra applet for finding the mirror of a reflection.      Use the Reflect About Line tool in the above app to check that reflecting across the line you created results in a triangle that aligns perfectly with .    Write down instructions of how you can create the reflecting line given a triangle and its reflected image . The instructions should be detailed enough that others can follow them.      Finding the Vector for a Translation  In , you were given a translation vector which indicated the direction and distance that each point should be moved, specifically three units right and one unit down. In the activity had the coordinates and had the coordinates . We will note that we could have chosen a different vector to represent three units right and one unit down.    If the point had the coordinates , what would the coordinates of be so that would represent a move of three units right and one unit down?    If the ending point has the coordinates , what would the coordinates of the starting point be so that would represent three units right and one unit down?    If point has the coordinates and the picture below shows a translation that moves the figure three units right and one unit down, what are the coordinates of ?    Draw, identify, or describe a vector for the translation that takes to in .   Triangle is translated to      Write instructions that you or someone else could use to find the translation vector when any figure and its image under a translation are given.      Finding the Center and Angle of a Rotation, part 1  In , an L-pentomino and its image under a rotation are shown.   Draw or identify the point that is the center of the rotation taking to . How do you know this point is the center?    Determine the angle of this rotation and specify whether the rotation is performed clockwise or counterclockwise.      To measure an angle on GeoGebra, be sure to click the vertex of the angle second. For example, would be found using the angle tool and clicking , , and in that counterclockwise order. If you click the vertices in the clockwise order, you will get .    An interactive GeoGebra applet for finding the center and angle of a rotation in .

GeoGebra tools will allow you to find perpendicular lines, perpendicular bisectors, angle bisectors, circles, angle measures, and lengths. Any ideas of what we might try?    Since we have sketched the segments , , and , use the perpendicular bisector tool to find the perpendicular bisector of each segment. What do you notice?    Create point as a candidate for your center. Verify that . What is the angle of rotation?    Finally, use the Rotate around Point tool to check your work.    Write instructions to yourself and others on how to find the center and angle of a rotation when you are given a picture of a figure and its rotated image and they do not share a vertex.         What have we learned?  In , the definining objects for each transformation were given. We now add new columns to this table. In the column, Orientation , write either changes or maintains for the entries. The column, Fixed Points is where you will identify the point(s), if any, that are fixed by the transformation, and in the column Properties of Object(s) , is where you should write the properties that can assist you in locating the defining object(s) for each type of transformation.

In fact, a transformation is a function where the inputs and outputs are geometric objects instead of numbers. In algebra, you learned about the add three function, written , and the multiply by four function, . You also learned that you could perform two functions in succession. For example, you could perform the add three function on the number and then perform the multiply by 4 function on the result.

If we multiply by 4 first and add 3 second, we get a different result:   We now explore what happens when we compose geometric transformations. We could compose any two transformations, but we will first focus on reflections. What happens when we perform two or more reflections in succession? Do we get another reflection?

Once again, we will consider the case where the lines are parallel and when they intersect. Will we get the same transformations as before or might these be something different?   Reflecting across three lines  Orientation  Recall that a reflection across a single line reverses the orientation.

Describe a two-transformation process that takes to .         The Four Isometries  In this chapter, we've explored the behavior of a particular type of transformation, called an isometry . This term comes from the Greek words iso- meaning equality and metria meaning measure .   isometry   An isometry is a function taking points on the plane to points on the plane which sends collinear points to collinear points and preserves the distance between points.    There are four types of isometries. Through our explorations, we have seen that the orientation of a figure is reversed each time it is reflected. Thus, orientation is changed under an odd number of reflections and maintained (flipped back) under an even number of reflections. Hence, the composition of two reflections in succession will be either a translation (when the reflecting lines are parallel) or a rotation (when the reflecting lines intersect). When we reflect across three lines, not all of which are parallel, we get an isometry which reverses the orientation of figures but is not a reflection. Instead we obtain what is known as a glide reflection.  A glide reflection is defined as a composition of a reflection across a line and a translation along a vector parallel to (or on) the reflecting line. In , note how the pentomino is first reflected across the line and then translated along vector . Any of the parallel vectors, like or , could be used as the translation vector, but the reflecting line here is , not . glide reflection    Glide reflection of a pentamino.   L-pentamino is reflected across line GH. Then its image is slid using vector GH. A and C are two vertices on the original.    Reflective Question  Will a glide reflection have any fixed point(s)? How do you know?    "

Review of Isometries  We know that an isometry is a transformation (or function) that preserves the measures of lines and angles. The original object and its image under an isometry are always congruent to each other. It turns out if we are given any two congruent figures in the plane there is an isometry that maps one of the figures onto the other.

Each point on one side of the line of symmetry reflects to a corresponding image point on the other side of the line and the image of a point reflects back across the line to the original point.  Reflectional symmetry is also called mirror symmetry and a line of symmetry may be called a mirror . It is possible for a design with mirror symmetry to have multiple lines of symmetry.     Symmetric design created using    An abstract design with four lines of symmetry and 90-degree rotational symmetry. A square or times symbol has similar symmetry.    Check your Understanding  Draw the four lines of symmetry in . Verify that the design stays the same when reflected across each line.     A design is said to have rotational symmetry if there is a rotation about a point with a positive angle of less than 360 degrees that maps the design onto itself. The image of the design will look identical to the original even in location and angle. The number of positions that the figure can be rotated to and still look the same is called the order of symmetry . In calculating the order of symmetry, we count a full 360-degree turn, but not a 0-degree rotation. If the order of symmetry of a figure is , we say that the figure has -fold symmetry.

Notice and Wonder  What did you notice about the lines of symmetry and centers of rotation as you were completing this activity? What do you wonder about symmetry of finite designs? What questions remain?      Symmetry Transformations   symmetry transformation  transformation symmetry   A symmetry transformation for a design is an isometry that sends the design perfectly onto itself. The appearance of the design remains the same after the action of a symmetry transformation.  We also may use just the word symmetry to refer to a symmetry transformation. The context of how the word appears will help us decide whether symmetry refers to the property of the design or the transformation that preserves the design.    In , we saw that when we performed a sequence of reflections in succession, the composition was the same as an isometry, either another reflection, a translation, a rotation, or a glide reflection depending on the number of reflections and whether the reflecting lines were parallel. With a finite design such as the one in , note that any lines of symmetry must intersect and their point of intersection will be in the center of the figure. If the figure also has rotational symmetry, the center of the rotation will also at this central point.  Reflective Questions  Explain why a translation and a glide reflection cannot be symmetry transformation of finite designs or polygons. Do you think translations and\/or glide reflections could be symmetry transformations of infinite tilings or infinite wallpaper borders? Explain in words and\/or pictures.   We now focus on the symmetries of a single equilateral triangle, investigating what happens when we compose symmetry transformations.   Symmetries of an Equilateral Triangle   Throughout this exploration, you may use the GeoGebra applet, as needed. For a tactile exploration, label and cut out an equilateral triangle that you can flip and rotate.   Rotations of an Equilateral Triangle  As previously discovered, an equilateral triangle has 3-fold symmetry.   What is the smallest positive degree angle of symmetry?    Suppose we use the label to represent a counterclockwise rotation by a 120-degree angle about the center of this triangle. What is the effect of performing twice in succession? Is it the same as a reflection or rotation? Specify the reflecting line (if it is a reflection) or rotation angle (if it is a rotation) of the composed transformation    What happens if you rotate the original triangle using three times in succession?    A 0-degree rotation can be represented by . Describe in your own words what happens when you apply . How does it compare to ?    A clockwise 120-degree rotation is the same as a counterclockwise rotation of what degree?      GeoGebra applet for exploring the symmetries of an equilateral triangle     1. 120 degrees  2. rotating counterclockwise by 240 degrees  3. Back to original position,  4. does nothing while performs a full rotation. The resulting image is the same.  5. 240 degrees.   Images of Symmetries  As we record the result of performing symmetries on the triangle in , we will use the notation , , to represent counterclockwise rotations of 0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees about the center of the triangle.  We will also use the notation , , and to denote the reflections across line with negative slope, line with positive slope, and the vertical line , respectively.  Because these are symmetries, the actions will always result in the same equilateral triangle. What changes is the locations of vertices , , and . Note that the image of the triangle after performing is the same as . We call this the Home Position. When using the GeoGebra applet , we can click on the icon in the upper right that looks like a circle with clockwise-oriented arrows to return to the Home Position.

Each entry you add to the table should always be one of the six symmetries of the triangle; namely, , , , , , or . When you use to compute compositions, be sure to reset the triangle to home position before performing the first of the two actions and then perform the second action without resetting the triangle. Compare the final result to the vertex labels you recorded in and then use the symbol, , , , , , or that corresponds to the output of the composition.

Now complete the -column, each time rotating counterclockwise 240 degrees before performing the symmetry corresponding to the row heading. Be sure to return to the home position before beginning each two-stage calculation.    Similarly, we will complete the -column by reflecting the home triangle across the line before performing the symmetry corresponding to the row heading.

  "body": " Transformations that Scale   In this section, we explore a type of transformation which changes the distance between points. Before introducing some examples on the Cartesian -plane, we review how the Pythagorean Theorem is used to compute distance between points.   To compute the length of a segment on a graph we use the Pythagorean Theorem. In , the coordinates of point are and of point are . We think of the segment as the hypotenuse of a triangle with a right angle at . The length of the horizontal leg is found by subtracting the -coordinates, , and the vertical distance by subtracting the -coordinates, . Then since segment is the hypotenuse of the right triangle , we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find its length, namely .   Measuring distance on a graph   Right triange ABC described above.

Show all work.         Self-similar Triangles  The right triangle in had the property that the altitude drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse split the triangle into two smaller triangles, both of which were similar to the original triangle. This property is true for all right triangles since the measure of the two acute angles did not matter. In particular, each new triangle had a right angle and one of the original angles. Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, the newly created angle will have the same measure as the remaining angle of the original triangle.  Will this happen with other triangles?   A Special Triangle   In , an isosceles triangle with two 72-degree angles is provided.

Hence, it is essential that we can simplify expressions and solve equations.   expression  algebraic expression  numerical expression   An expression in mathematics is a representation of a numerical quantity consisting of a finite number of variables and\/or numbers joined by algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. An expression is said to be algebraic if it contains at least one variable. We will also use the term numerical expression to describe any representation that is either an algebraic expression or number.    Note the difference between an expression and an equation.   algebraic equation  equation   An equation is a statement formed by joining two algebraic expressions together with an equal sign. When we solve an equation, we determine which numerical quantities will make the statement true.    The equals sign is also used when we simplify a statement, joining the equivalent expressions immediately preceding and following the sign. In this situation, a series of equal signs in succession are allowed. You show verify that any expressions joined by this symbol are indeed equal.

  "title": "Functions and Operations",
  "body": " Functions and Operations   Operations, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, give us a way of combining numbers and expressions. It is worth the time to read the symbols that tell us what operation is being used.  Functions typically involve operations, but they play a different role. A function is a rule that allows us to assign an output for each allowable input. In algebra, functions are often given by an algebraic expression where we can replace the variable by the input and compute the value of the corresponding output. We also use letters, like or , to name our function. The symbol stands for the output when function is performed on and the symbol stands for the output when function is performed on . When graphing functions, we think of each output of the function as being and graph the pairs .   A Function from Algebra   Let . Compute the following:               a) , b) , c) which can be simplified to .    Functions do not have to have algebraic formulas; for example, we could define a function that assigns the number 0 to all even numbers and 1 to all odd numbers. In this example, , , and . In geometry, we will be looking at transformations, which are functions that map points to points. Sometimes, we can write geometric functions algebraically like but that goes beyond the scope of this course.  Having seen some examples, we now give the definition of function.   function   A function is a mapping that assigns to each input exactly one output.    As noted above the inputs and outputs be numbers or other objects such as points or even lines. What distinguishes a function from other mappings is that each input has exactly one output . Although it is possible for several inputs to have the same output, say , it is not possible for and . Under the action of a function, each input uniquely determines its output.    Working with squares and square roots  Two functions of interest to us in geometry are the squaring function and the square root function .   square root  square   The square of a number is the number . Note that the number may be negative, positive, or 0, but the square, is always greater than or equal to 0.  The square root of a number is the nonnegative number such that . We use the notation to represent the square root of .     Computing Squares and Square Roots   Compute the following using the definitions of square and square root. A calculator should not be necessary.                  a) , b) , c) , d)     In , we observe how the actions of squaring and taking the square root undo each other. The square of is and the square root of is . Similarly, the square root of is and the square of is . Thus, when we perform a square and a square root in succession, the two actions cancel each other out. For this reason, the squaring function and the square root function are said to be inverse operations on the set of nonnegative numbers A number is said to be nonnegative if . . Since geometric measurements are nonnegative, we may use the square root function to undo the squaring function and vice versa. Thus, whenever you would like to undo the squaring function in an equation such as in the above example, we will take the square root of both sides.   Inverse Property of Squares and Square Roots   Let be a nonnegative real number. Then and .    Using the Pythagorean Theorem to find lengths will require squaring and taking square roots of numbers. The equation in the Pythagorean Theorem can be written equivalently as or . Note the use of the inverse action: . In fact, the squaring function also undoes the square root function: . This is what we mean by a pair of inverse functions; applying them one right after the other (in either order) cancels their action. On the other hand, we need to be careful in applying an inverse operation. The square root of is not equal to because the square of is not . Instead, the square of is so that .   Finding the Length of a Leg of a Right Triangle   The length of the hypotenuse is 16 inches and the length of one leg is 10 inches. Determine the length of the other leg.    By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know or . Subtracting from both sides of the equation, we get . Taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we see     Our examples demonstrate that , but what if the operation is multiplication or division? In this situation, the expression can be simplified.   Exponents and Roots of Products and Quotients   Let and be nonnegative real numbers. Then and If , then and .  Moreover, if is any nonnegative integer, we can say that and . Also and when .      Other Pairs of Inverse Functions  The square and square root functions are not the only pair of functions that undo each other. Some pairs that you may be more familiar with include adding and subtracting and the two function, dividing by and multiplying by . Note how the two functions in each pair undo each other and recall how you have used them to solve equations.  Extending the equality principles, and , we often use the method of performing the same operation to both sides of an equation. Typically, the chosen operation is the inverse of an operation that appears in the equation.  When working in three dimensional geometry, we will need to compute the cube of a number which we can write as or . The cubing function and cube root function are also inverses of each other.   Using Inverses to Solve an Equation   Solve the equation .    Adding to both sides of gives us . Next we divide the expressions on both sides by , resulting in . Finally, we take the cube root of both sides, leaving us with . Checking our answer, we verify that as desired.      Order of Operations  In , you may have wondered whether it was better to add four first or divide by five. Would it even make a difference?  Because of the way that operations are built on each other Multiplication is repeated addition, and exponentiation is repeated multiplication. , the order of performing algebraic operations is prescribed. When performing computations, we perform exponentiation before multiplication and division and we perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. We also perform computations from left to right. Parentheses or other grouping symbols, such as a fraction bar We can also use placement and size of type, like or . , are used when we want to treat a numerical expression as a single quantity. Thus, we start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out.  When there are variables in an expression, we may not be able to perform operations in the standard order. Without a specified value, we cannot add a number like to an expression like . Instead, we use the distributive law and concept of like terms to simplify our expression.  As equations become more complex, there is no specific order in which to perform inverse operations. If one or both sides can be simplified, that is often a good first or intermediate step. Undoing operations is typically done in the reverse order, just as we need to unpeel layers of clothing in the evening, each item being removed in the opposite order in which it was put on. Our goal in a linear equation is to get down to a single appearance of the variable and to isolate that variable, as in . In polynomial equations, we usually aim to manipulate the expression until all variables and nonzero numbers are on one side of the equation so that we can factor the expression and apply to find all solutions.   Solving Equations with Order of Operations   Solve the equation, .    We will demonstrate several methods. To emphasize how order of operations are reversed when undoing operations, we note that adding 8 would be last in a computation. Thus our first step is to subtract 8 (or add ) to both sides of our equation, resulting in . Next we, divide both sides by , leaving . Finally, we add to get .  Note that if we start by dividing by 5, tells us that we must also divide 8 by 5. The resulting equation, or , is correct but more difficult to solve.  Finally, we could solve this equation by first simplifying the left side. Our expression Replacing the original left side by this simplified version gives . Adding to both sides gives and dividing by 5 gives .     "

  "body": " Solving Equations with Order of Operations   Solve the equation, .    We will demonstrate several methods. To emphasize how order of operations are reversed when undoing operations, we note that adding 8 would be last in a computation. Thus our first step is to subtract 8 (or add ) to both sides of our equation, resulting in . Next we, divide both sides by , leaving . Finally, we add to get .  Note that if we start by dividing by 5, tells us that we must also divide 8 by 5. The resulting equation, or , is correct but more difficult to solve.  Finally, we could solve this equation by first simplifying the left side. Our expression Replacing the original left side by this simplified version gives . Adding to both sides gives and dividing by 5 gives .   "
