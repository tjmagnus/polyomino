        <title>Defining Pyramids and Cones</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we will learn about pyramids and cones and how they are 
            related to prisms and cylinders.

                    A <term>pyramid</term> is a polyhedron which may have any polygon as its 
                    base but the all remaining faces are triangles that share a common 
                    vertex called the <term>apex</term>.  The <term>height</term> of the 
                    pyramid is measured from the apex to the plane containing the base 
                    along a line perpendicular to this plane.

                    We name each pyramid according to its base. Thus, a triangular pyramid has 
                    a triangular base, a square pyramid has a square base, and so forth. Also, the 
                    apex of the pyramid need not be directly above the center of the base; in fact, 
                    the apex may not be directly above any part of the pyramid.

        <p>
            With both prisms and pyramids, formulas exist to compute the surface area of some of 
            the common types, but these formulas are not necessary. If we can compute the areas of 
            each face, then the surface area is simply the sum of the areas of the faces. 
        </p>
        <p>
            How can we find the volume of a pyramid? It is a fact that the volume of a pyramid is
            exactly one-third of the volume of the prism with the same stretch distance. Since we know that 
            the volume of a prism is <m>V=Ad</m>, the volume of a pyramid must be 
            <m>V=\frac{Ad}{3}</m> where <m>A</m> is the area of the base and <m>d</m> is the 
            stretch distance or height. In fact, this works for cones as well. The volume of a 
            cone is <m>V=\frac{(\pi r^2)d}{3}</m> since the area of the circular base is 
            <m>A=\pi r^2</m>.
