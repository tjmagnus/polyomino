    <introduction>
    <p>
        Having looked at area as the measure of the interior space of a polygon, 
        we now turn our attention to measuring angles. What is an angle and how do 
        we measure it?

            To fully grasp the definition of angle, we need to first   
            understand the difference between lines, segments, and rays.

                    A <term>line</term> is a one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely 
                    in opposite directions. In Euclidean geometry, lines are straight, but we 
                    will encounter a geometry in which they are curved. One important trait of 
                    lines is that any pair of distinct points lie on exactly one line. For this 
                    reason, we may denote the line through points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> as 
                    <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <term>line segment</term> is the part of a line bounded by two endpoints.
                    Line segment <m>\overline{AB}</m> consists of <term>endpoints</term>
                    <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> and all points on line 
                    <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m> which lie between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike a line, a line segment has finite length. We define the <term>length</term> of 
                    <m>\overline{AB}</m> to be the distance from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m>. 
                    We use the notation <m>m(\overline{AB})</m> or simply <m>AB</m> to denote the 
                    length of <m>\overline{AB}</m>.

            Whereas a line continues infinitely in two directions, a ray continues
            infinitely in just one direction and has an 
            endpoint.

                An <term>angle</term> is the union of two rays with a common endpoint.
                In particular, <m>\angle BAC</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-angle-def"/>, 
                consists of all points that lie on the 
                rays <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> and <m>\overrightarrow{AC}</m>. The common 
                endpoint <m>A</m> of the rays is called the <term>vertex</term> of the 
                angle and the two rays <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> and <m>\overrightarrow{AC}</m>
                are called the <term>sides</term> of the angle.

    <p>
        To think of the measure of an angle as the space between the rays is  
        vague and misleading. The area between the rays is infinite. Note also  
        that the points <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> on the sides of <m>\angle{BAC}</m>
        do not play a role in defining or measuring the angle. If <m>D</m> is any other point 
        on ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> other than <m>A</m>,
        then <m>\angle{DAC}</m> is the same angle 
        as <m>\angle{BAC}</m> and hence has the same measure. Thus it would make  
        no sense to use the linear distance between <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> for measuring 
        <m>\angle{BAC}</m>. The sides of an angle are infinite and extend beyond what can 
        be drawn. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Instead, we think of angle measurement in terms of rotational movement around the vertex, specifically 
        the amount of rotation needed to move one side of the angle on top of the other.

            To begin our study of angle measure, we will adopt the practice of 
            assuming that there are 360 degrees in a
            full rotation about any point. The choice of 360 can be traced back 
            to the Babylonians who were studying planetary paths around 400 B.C. 
            and used a base 60 (instead of base 10) number system. One advantage 
            of the number 360 is that it has a lot of factors including 2, 3, 4, 
            5, 6, and 8. This results in more pleasing numbers when we consider 
            fractions of a circle.

            Continuing, we define the measurement of angles according to what 
            fraction of a full (or half) rotation they represent. Notice how the  
            protractor in <xref ref="protractor"/> divides the semicircular arc 
            into 180 segments, eighteen of which are labeled 
            with numerical values. These multiples of ten are fractions of the
            half rotation 180 degrees, for example 
            <m>\frac{1}{18}(180)=10, \frac{2}{18}(180)=20, \dots, \frac{18}{18}(180)=180</m>.
            To find the measure of <m>\angle{DAB}</m>, we  
            place the center dot of the protractor over the vertex <m>A</m> of the 
            angle and lined up ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> with the mark for 0 
            degrees. The other side of the angle <m>\overrightarrow{AD}</m> passes  
            through the mark for 40 degrees.

            A <term>line</term> is a one-dimensional figure consisting of a set of  
            points. It does not have any thickness. Because a line extends infinitely 
            in both directions
            and has no endpoints, we cannot measure the length of a line. For any two 
            distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both of them so 
            we may refer 
            to a line by a pair of points on the line, <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m> 
            or by a single lower case letter such as <m>\ell</m> or <m>m</m>.  
          </p>
          <p>
            When we talk about measuring length, we are referring to a 
            line segment. A <term>line segment</term> is a part of a line consisting 
            of a pair of endpoints and all of the points on the line between the 
            two endpoints. For example, line segment <m>\overline{AB}</m> 
            consists of points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> and all points on line
            <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m> between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a similar way, we define <term>ray</term> <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>
            to consist of point <m>A</m>, point <m>B</m>, and all points on line

            When we measure an angle, denoted <m>m\angle ABC</m>, 
            we are measuring how far we would need to rotate 
            one side of the angle 
            around the vertex to meet the other side. This definition introduces some  
            ambiguity as one might rotate clockwise or counterclockwise and we could even
            rotate multiple times around the vertex. Typically, we will consider the measure 
            of an angle to be a number between 0 and 180 but there will be some exceptions. 
            When we study symmetry and 
            isometry later in <xref ref="ch-isom"/>, we will allow a wider variety of  
            rotations. In addition, we might speak of the interior of some angles of a 
            concave polygon as having at least one interior angle with a measure 
            between 180 and 360 degrees.

                        Angle <m>\angle{ACB}</m> is <m>67^{\circ}</m> because its vertical angle also measures
                        <m>67^{\circ}</m>. Angle <m>\angle{BCF}</m> is <m>24^{\circ}</m>. To find <m>\angle{ACF}</m>, combine the
                        angle measures of <m>\angle{ACB}</m> and <m>\angle{BCF}</m>: <m>67^{\circ}+24^{\circ}=91^{\circ}</m>.
                        Therefore, <m>m(\angle{ACF})=91^{\circ}</m>.

                        In a previous problem, it was determined that <m>m(\angle{CEF})=39^{\circ}</m>.
                        To find <m>\angle{CDE}</m>, subtract the given <m>39^{\circ}</m> from <m>89^{\circ}</m>:
                        <m>89^{\circ}-39^{\circ}=50^{\circ}</m>. Therefore, <m>m(\angle{CDE})=91^{\circ}</m>.

                        The Angle Sum Theorem states that a triangle's interior angles always sum to
                        <m>180^{\circ}</m>. Angle <m>m(\angle{ACB})=67^{\circ}</m> because it is vertical to
                        <m>\angle{DCE}</m> and vertical angles are equal in measure. With <m>m(\angle{ACB})=67^{\circ}</m>,
                        the remaining two angles, <m>\angle{ABC}</m> and <m>\angle{BAC}</m>, must sum to 
                        <m>180^{\circ}-67^{\circ}=113^{\circ}</m>.

                    Different interpretations of angles in a concave quadrilateral 
                    can be made here. In your explanation, 
                    you may need to specify whether you are looking only at interior angles or 
                    only considering angles less than 180 degrees.
