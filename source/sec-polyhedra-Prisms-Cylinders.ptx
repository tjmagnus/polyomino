            We now explore the geometric solid known as a <term>prism</term> in 
            greater detail. As noted in <xref ref="def-prism"/>, a prism is a 
            box-like geometric solid with a pair of congruent and parallel polygonal  
            faces, called the base and the summit, joined by a band of parallelograms.
            The number of parallelograms connecting the bases will always equal 
            the number of sides of each base.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are most familiar with <term>right prisms</term>, namely prisms 
            where the bases meet all the side faces at right angles; the side faces of a 
            right prism are rectangles. An <term>oblique prism</term>, on the other hand, 
            will have parallelograms other than rectangles as its side faces.

            A cylinder is not a polyhedron since it has circular 
            bases; however, there are some important similarities between prisms and
            cylinders. Both have parallel, congruent bases.

                    Besides the parallel circles, what other shape(s) is needed 
                    to form the surface of a right cylinder? How many of these shapes are there?

                <p>
                    Cut two circles out of paper to cover a cylindrical can. What else do 
                    you need to cover the exposed surface?

                <p>
                    The two circles are joined by a single rectangle. The width of this 
                    rectangle equals the circumference of a circular end.

            An important measurement for prisms and cylinders is the distance between 
            the bases. Many geometry textbooks use the term <term>height</term> to 
            describe this distance.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-height-prism">
            <idx><h>height</h><h>prism</h></idx>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    The <term>height</term> of a prism or cylinder is the distance between the 
                    parallel congruent bases and is measured along a line perpendicular to the 
                    bases. When a prism or cylinder is sitting on a side other than a
                    base, the height will be measured laterally instead of vertically. In this 
                    text, the word <term>stretch</term> will be used in lieu of <sq>height</sq> 
                    to clarify which dimension is being discussed.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stretch (or height) of a right prism is usually measured along an 
                    edge of one of the rectangular sides, like <m>d</m> in <xref ref="fig-rt-prism"/>.
                    On the other hand, the stretch of a skew prism, such as the one illustrated in 
                    <xref ref="fig-skew-prism"/>, will be less than the height of a side face. Similarly,
                    the stretch of a cylinder is also measured at a right angle to the base as 
                    indicated by <m>d</m> in <xref ref="fig-rt-skew-cyl"/>.

                        Explain why the formula for the volume of a rectangular 
                        box is <m>V=\ell wh</m> where <m>\ell</m> is the height, 
                        <m>w</m> is the width, and <m>h</m> is the height of the box.

                    <p>
                        When <m>h</m> is a whole number, it makes sense to think about 
                        the height as the number of layers. Not all measurements are whole 
                        numbers though. Instead we can think of <m>h</m> as the amount that 
                        we need to stretch that first layer to reach the summit of the prism.
                        Consider the rectangular prism in <xref ref="fig-prismwithhalfunits"/>

                        inches and <m>w=6</m> inches, and a stretch of <m>d=2.5</m> inches. Find the

                        not just rectangular ones. Suppose a cylinder has a circular base with area 
                        9.4 square centimeters. If the cylinder is one centimeter tall, we will say that

            Exploration <xref ref="exp-vol-intuitive" text="title"/> showed that the 
            the volume of a prism or cylinder was equal to the area of the base 
            times the number of horizontal layers.  Although you may be familiar with the 
            formula <m>V=\ell wh</m>, it is preferable to have a single formula that
            allows us to compute the volume of all prisms, not just rectangular prisms. 
            Note that the formula <m>V=(\ell w)d</m> is equivalent to the 
            formula <m>V=Ad</m> where <m>A=\ell w</m>  is the area of one base of 
            a rectangular prism and <m>d</m> is the distance (or stretch) between the bases, 
            measured perpendicular to the bases.  This volume formula <m>V=Ad</m> 
            will extend to all prisms and even cylinders!  
            Much less to memorize!
            To find the volume of any prism or cylinder, whether right or oblique, 
            we need only compute the area of the base and then multiply this area 
            by the stretch between the bases.

                        The answers in (b) involve irrational numbers, namely 
                        a square root and <m>\pi</m>. Your answer to (c) will be 
                        more accurate if you use the actual square root and <m>\pi</m>, 
                        not their estimates, in your calculation of volume. If you 
                        do use estimates, include at least four digits after the decimal point 
                        when inputting the values into part (c).
