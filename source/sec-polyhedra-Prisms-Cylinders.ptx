            Let us explore the geometric solid known as a <term>prism</term> in 
            greater detail. As noted in <xref ref="def-prism"/>, a prism is a 
            box-like geometric solid with a pair of congruent and parallel polygonal  
            faces, the base and the summit, joined by a band of parallelograms.
            The number of parallelograms connecting the bases will always equal 
            the number of sides of a base.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are most familiar with <term>right prisms</term>, namely prisms 
            where the bases meet all the side faces at right angles; the side faces of a 
            right prism are rectangles. A <term>skew prism</term> is a prism with 
            at least one side face is not a rectangle.

            Although a cylinder is not a polyhedron since it has a circular 
            base, we will see that there are some similarities between prisms and
            cylinders. Both have parallel, congruent bases.

                    Besides the parallel circles, what other shape(s) is needed 
                    to form a cylinder? How many of these shapes are there?

                    Cut out pieces of paper to cover a cylindrical can. In addition to 
                    the two circles, what else do you need?

                    The two circles are joined by a single rectangle. The width of this 
                    rectangle equals the circumference of a circular end.

            An important measurement for prisms and cylinders is the distance between 
            the bases. Many geometry textbooks use the term <term>height</term> to 
            describe this distance.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-height-prism">
            <idx><h>height</h><h>prism</h></idx>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    The <term>height</term> of a prism or cylinder is the distance between the 
                    parallel congruent bases and is measured along a line perpendicular to the 
                    bases. When a prism or cylinder is sitting on a side other than a
                    base, the height will be measured laterally instead of vertically. In fact, 
                    this text will use the word <term>stretch</term> in lieu of <sq>height</sq> where 
                    confusion may occur. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The height or stretch of a right prism is usually measured along an 
                    edge of one of the rectangular sides, like <m>d</m> in <xref ref="fig-rt-prism"/>.
                    The stretch of a skew prism, on the other hand, 
                    will be less than the height of a side face as illustrated in 
                    <xref ref="fig-skew-prism"/>.

                        Explain why the formula for the volume of a rectangular 
                        box is <m>V=\ell wh</m> where <m>\ell</m> is the height, 
                        <m>w</m> is the width, and <m>h</m> is the height of the box.

                    <p>
                        When <m>h</m> is a whole number, it makes sense to think about 
                        the height as the number of layers. Not all measurements are whole 
                        numbers though. Instead we can think of <m>h</m> as the amount that 
                        we need to stretch that first layer to reach the summit of the prism.
                        Suppose that our rectangular prism has the dimensions, <m>\ell=5</m>
                        inches, <m>w=6</m> inches, and a stretch of <m>d=2.5</m> inches. Find the 
                        volume of the prism.

                            Here you may be imagining two layers with a half layer on top of them. 
                            The half cubes (<m>1''\times 1''\times 0.5''</m>-cubes on the top layer 
                            can be paired to create full <m>1''\times 1''\times 1''</m>-cubes.

        <p>
            Exploration <xref ref="exp-vol-intuitive" text="title"/> showed that the 
            the volume of a prism or cylinder was equal to the area of the base 
            times the number of horizontal layers.  While you may be used to the 
            formula <m>V=\ell wh</m>, this formula only works for rectangular prisms. 
            Instead, note that this formula <m>V=(\ell w)d</m> is equivalent to the 
            formula <m>V=Ad</m> where <m>A=\ell w</m>  is the area of one base of 
            a rectangular prism and <m>d</m> is the distance between the bases, 
            measured perpendicular to the bases.  This volume formula <m>V=Ad</m> 
            will extend to ALL prisms and even cylinders!  Much less to memorize!
            We only need to compute the area of the base and then multiply the area 
            by the distance between the bases.

                        Create a formula for a cylinder with height <m>h</m> 
                        where the radius of each circular base is <m>r</m>. Your 
                        formula should contain the variables <m>h</m> and <m>r</m>.
                        Then check that your formula give the same result as you found in

        <title>The Surface Area of Prisms and Cylinders</title>
        <p>
            While the volume measures the amount of interior space of a 
            3-dimensional solid, the <term>surface area</term> measures the amount of 
            material needed to create the shell or surface of the solid.  
            To compute surface area, we simply compute the area of each face 
            and add the areas together. <idx><h>surface area</h></idx>
