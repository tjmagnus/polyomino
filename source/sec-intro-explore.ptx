      <title>To The Student</title>
   
    <p>
      This class may be different from many of the mathematics classes you have 
      taken in the past.  You will be encouraged to explore geometrical ideas, 
      solve puzzles, make conjectures, discuss with classmates, make connections 
      between ideas, explain your solutions, and justify your reasoning.  You 
      should not expect to be shown how to do problems by the instructions. In 
      fact, there may not be one, single right way to complete some of the 
      problems but rather many acceptable ways of coming to a solution.  Your 
      teacher will encourage you to share these alternative approaches with the 
      class. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this course would be easier for you if you were simply told 
      how to solve the problems, but the objective of this course is not 
      to learn facts and methods, but rather to develop your mathematical 
      thinking and communication skills.  In this technological age, 
      computers can do many of the algorithms and processes that used to 
      be the core of mathematics education, but they have not replaced man’s 
      role of developing strategies to solve problems and recognizing when 
      mathematics can be applied to real world situations.  Developing these 
      reasoning skills will help you more in your future than simply being able 
      to quote the Pythagorean Theorem. On the other hand, it is still useful to 
      know the Pythagorean Theorem so that you are able to recognize when it can 
      (and cannot) be used to solve both elementary and complex problems.  This 
      theorem along with some other basic formulas you have learned in the past 
      (and can look up online) form a toolbox for our work, but we will give more 
      emphasis to the creative process that is mathematics.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In <q>A Mathematician’s Lament</q> Paul Lockhart describes a nightmare 
      in which music was taught in the same way that mathematics is currently 
      taught.<!--~\cite{lament}-->  He says, 
    </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, 
          intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it 
          makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t 
          understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to 
          be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful 
          beauty; to be alive.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If we were to teach music via lecture and mere recall, 
          focusing on the notation and structure, but not allowing students to experience 
          and create music, the subject would be dry and uninteresting, the creative 
          process would be stifled, and very few would have an interest in learning 
          music.  Yet, that is what we have done with much of our mathematics instruction.  
          We have removed both the exploration and the fun. <xref ref="Lockhart"/>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      So I encourage you to embrace the experience that is mathematics.  
      Approach each puzzle with an open mind, make guesses as to what is 
      happening, and experiment to determine whether your ideas are correct.  
      Play with the materials and the concepts and ask new questions.  In this 
      course, you might even be invited to explore a question you posed instead 
      of the one the teacher originally posed!  Mathematics is not just about finding the answer; 
      even when there is an answer, our work should evoke new questions: Why? What else?

          Although this task is to fill a box, you are encouraged to think 
          outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a 
          willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will  
          be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect 
          as you respond to the "why" questions and sharing your ideas with 
          your classmates will also contribute 
          greatly to your learning. Have fun!

          The purpose of <xref ref="intro-explore-exp-pentrect"/> is two-fold. It introduces the exploratory 
          nature of the course and it also suggests a few important geometric facts and definitions that 
          we will use as our initial geometrical foundation. These facts are chosen because  
          they are intuitively obvious, but they give us some building blocks we will need to 
          justify more complex ideas. We state them here for clarity and future reference beginning 
          with a definition for area.

          We noted that each tetromino was made up of four unit squares and 
          each pentomino consisted of five unit squares; thus 
          the area of a tetromino is four square units and the area of a 
          pentomino is five square units. We also recalled the area formula for 
          a rectangle.

              The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width; in 
              symbols, <m>A=\ell \times w</m>.

          Another observation is that if you can fill a closed region with smaller 
          shapes so that none of the smaller shapes overlap and no part of the region 
          is left uncovered, then the area of the region is equal to the sum of the 
          areas of the smaller shapes. While this may seem like a simple idea, we will  
          see that it allows us to determine the area formulas of other geometric  
          shapes and to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. We can dissect <idx><h>dissect</h></idx> 
          shape into smaller shapes, rearrange them into another shape, and argue 
          that the two regions have the same area because they both consist of the same 
          colllection of smaller shapes.

          <title>Additivity of Area</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              If a region can be cut into non-overlapping sections, 
              the area of the whole region is equal to the sum of the 
              areas of the sections.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </principle> 
        <p>
          We applied these two principles in <xref ref="hiddenapp-pentominofilling"/>
          where we attempted to construct rectangles using pentominoes. Since pentominoes 
          have an area of five square units, we could only construct rectangles with areas 
          divisible by 5, namely 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60. 
          <fn>To construct a rectangle of area 10, the same pentomino must be used twice.</fn>
          In the same way, any shape made up entirely of tetrominoes must have an area 
          divisible by 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we observed that when the lengths of all sides of a two-dimensional 
          figure are doubled (or tripled), the area of the figure is muliplied by 4 (or 9).
          This is easy to observe in a rectangle with length <m>\ell</m> and width <m>w</m>. 
          When we create a new rectangle with length <m>L=2\ell</m> and width <m>W=2w</m>, 
          the resulting area is <m>LW=(2\ell)(2w)=(2\cdot 2)(\ell w)=4\ell w</m> square units.

          Hopefully as you worked through these tasks, you allowed yourself 
          to experiment with different arrangements of squares and 
          polyominoes. This openness to creative exploration is essential to 
          mathematical thinking. Phrases like "what if" or "I wonder"  
          arise often as mathematicians create and make sense 
          of new ideas. If you find yourself wanting to explore a question arising 
          from a task but not explicitly asked, jot down your question and share it 
          with your instructor. Your instructor might encourage you to investigate your 
          question or even invite your classmates to consider it.<fn>Some questions may 
          be addressed in a later section, too tangential, beyond the scope of this course, 
          or even unsolved by the mathematical community. Thus your instructor will 
          make the decision on which questions to pursue and when. 
          </fn>
        </p>
        <p> 
          You may have noticed that you and your peers discovered 
          different ways of completing the same task. Multiple approaches and 
          multiple solutions are often welcome and even encouraged! If you have a 
          strategy that is different than your group members, try both separately 
          and then compare. You have the ability to do the mathematics, but it will  
          be more meaningful if you attack tasks in a way that makes sense to you.
          This will require you and your peers to take some risks, to challenge you to 
          speak up, and to be nonjudgmental of others.
        </p>
        <p> 
          In fact, doing mathematics is a social activity. When we notice 
          patterns and make conjectures, we share our ideas with others and 
          use logic to make convincing arguments. For over 2500 years, mathematicians 
          have been adding to the body of mathematical knowledge; some of which has 
          been shared with you during your studies. The field of mathematics continues 
          to grow. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, most students have had little opportunity to 
          creatively explore in their mathematics classes. You have probably 
          memorized formulas and performed calculations in many of your mathematics 
          classes. While formulas and calculations are useful tools
          in mathematics, they are not the essence of mathematics and 
          can often be done via a computer. In this course, 
          we will develop the creative 
          thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving practices that set humans apart  
          computers and are valued by employers. We will think outside the box, 
          make predictions, and wonder why. Different approaches and strategies are encouraged. 
          Relax and have fun exploring mathematics!

                x with a horizontal line cutting the rectangle between these two segments. 
                The bottom edge is composed of a segment of length 5 plus a segment 
                of length 4x. A vertical line cuts the rectangle between these two segments.

              A tetrahedral die is a triangular pyramid with four sides numbered 1 
              through 4.  Because the die is shaped like a triangular pyramid, 
              there is no top face so the number rolled will correspond to the top point 
              if the dice are labeled like the ones to the right.  
              If three tetrahedral die are rolled the possible sums range from  3  to 12. 
              For example, consider the sum 5 which can be achieved by each of the 
              following six rolls:  
              (1,1,3), (1,2,2), (1,3,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (3,1,1).
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Determine all of the ways that a sum of 9 can occur.

                    rolled with three tetrahedral dice.  Note that the sums are 
                    given on the horizontal axis

                A symmetric histogram graph is shown. The following rectangular bars appear on the 
                graph, each with width 1 and base on the x-axis. Above the number 3 and 
                above the number 12, sits a rectangle with
                height 1. Above both 4 and 11, the bar's height is 3. Above both 5 and 10, the 
                height is 6. Above both 6 and 9, the height is 10. And above both 7 and 8, 
                the height is 12.

            Write an essay (2 to 4 pages) in which you discuss the experiences 
            in your life that have formed you as a mathematician or geometer. 
            This essay will be unique to you, but here are some questions that 
            you might consider in your reflection: 
            Were there any turning points in your education? What experiences 
            have stimulated and which have stimied your mathematical growth? 
            Are there obstacles that you 
            have overcome or would like to overcome? How? What are you personal 
            goals in this course? What do you see as personal challenges to being 
            successful?  
          </p>
          <p>
            The paper should <em>not</em> be a mere timeline (boring!) or a list of answers to the 
            questions above (disjointed), but instead <em>should</em> be a cohesive  
            essay that focuses on the development of your mathematical ability, confidence, 
            and attitude, centering on a few key turning points.  Examples of experiences 
            that help illustrate your statements should be included. 
            How did the class format (lecture, testing, activities, interaction,
            pacing) change you? Did you have experiences beyond the classroom that affected 
            your mathematical growth? <!--This essay should 
            demonstrate that you have thought deeply about the topic.  
            Your attitude and definition of mathematics might not match your instructor's, 
            but that is okay in this paper where your personal reflections matter.-->
          </p>
          <p>
            You may be asked to look back on this essay at the end of the semester  
            to assess personal growth. Your instructor may also use this autobiography to 
            better understand you as a student. In case your instructor knows your past teachers,
            use psuedonyms or letters to refer to them. The essay should focus 
            on you, not your teachers.
