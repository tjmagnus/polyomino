        <title>General Notes on Writing</title>
        <p>
            Although I am including writing prompts for most sections, I 
            typically only assign two explanatory papers (the area formula for 
            a trapezoid and the Pythagorean Theorem) and three to five journal essays
            (these vary, but typically include the autobiography, the essay on wonder, 
            and a reflection on Lockhart's "A Mathematician's Lament"). I recognize that 
            my students have little, if any, experience in writing mathematical explanations. 
            When I teach this course, I build revisions of these two papers into the 
            schedule and grading specifications. Some of the journal writing prompts can 
            be assigned at any point during the course. Teaching this  
            course in the winter/spring semester, we typically have at least one snow day and the essay on 
            wonder is a nice assignment to use in lieu of a class. I have found that students  
            may not be ready to write the reflection on "A Mathematician's Lament" early in 
            the semester. Well into the semester, many students are hanging on to the belief that 
            math is simply a collection of tools to memorize and use. I also assign a 
            final portfolio in which students discuss growth in their mathematical abilities, 
            understanding, and attitude. I am happy to share a copy of my portfolio assignment, 
            detailed descriptions of the two explanatory papers, and my specifications grading rubric.

                Eventually, I will create a website with these handouts.
                Perhaps, I'll add an early and late reflection on Lockhart's 
                essay.

        <title>Notes for <xref ref="sec-intro-explore"/></title>
        <p>
            The first exploratory activity should not require much of an introduction and 
            provides an opportunity for students to get to know a few classmates  
            and experience a tactile or visual learning experience 
            in a low-stress environment. Expectations of group work can begin 
            to be established. Although this activity may be done via applets embedded 
            within the online version of the textbook, I prefer to have my students
            complete this activity in small groups (three per group) with a worksheet 
            and graph paper. A handout for the inclass version 
            of this activity 
            is available 
            to instructors by request.<!--on the book website Also make sure that 
            the pdf version has tetromino and pentomino cut-outs-->. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I provide each group with a set of plastic pentominoes only after 
            they have discovered most of them through experimentation. 
            Printable pentominoes that could be cut out can easily be found on 
            the web. For students completing this exploration in the online 
            textbook, I have hidden the last interactive inside the 
            hint to <xref ref="hiddenapp-pentominofilling"/>, so that the answer 
            to students will 
            take some time trying to create the twelve pentominoes in 
            <xref ref="create-pentominoes"/> without having the answer immediately
            visible. For another option, this exploration 
            is available as a Desmos classroom activity, 
            <url href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/648a1bcce94034a3fecf0109"></url>. 
            however, the instructor may wish to break this up (make two copies to 
            edit) into two four-slide 
            activities so that the slides with the pentominoes will not be visible 
            too soon. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This activity also plays an important role in preparing students for much 
            of the work to come. We will build upon the <xref ref="def-area" text="custom">
            definition of area</xref>, the <xref ref="formula-area-rectangle" text="custom">
            area formula of a rectangle</xref>, and  
            <xref ref="principle-areasums" text="custom">Additivity of Area</xref> 
            as we compute areas of other shapes and prove the Pythagorean Theorem. 
            We will also introduce additivity of length, angle measure, and volume. 
            These intuitive concepts have many applications and connections.
            As part of the post-exploration discussion, you may want 
            to remind the students about how area is simply the number 
            of unit squares that fill the interior. It can be noted how 
            the area formula for a rectangle is easy to remember and related 
            to the operation for multiplication. We will be using 
            the fact that the total area is preserved when a figure is cut into 
            smaller figures and then rearranged to form a new figure. This principle 
            will be used to derive area formulas for other figures and to demonstrate 
            the universality of the Pythagorean Theorem. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I often assign a math autobiography at the beginning of the semester and
           and have students refer back to it in their final portfolio. Students often 
           respond positively to the "Notice and Wonder" reflective writing assignment
           based on Eddie Wu's TedX talk, 
           <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXwStduNw14"/>
           <!--is this the same video?-->
        .
           The latter makes a good "snow day" activity. I have been less successful 
           with students' response to "A Mathematician's Lament" by Paul Lockhart. Many 
           students fail to see how mathematics is creative like art, especially at the 
           beginning of the semester.

        <p>
            This section has a shorter exploration, but establishes many of the 
            early definitions that are needed early in this text. In the exploration, 
            students can use "matching up" as a way to identify whether 
            two lengths are the same. As mentioned in the activity, most of the work can be 
            done without using the square root, but I typically find students wanting to 
            use it anyway. One algebraic item that might be discussed here or in the next section
            is <m>\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}=2\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{4}\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{8}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is an opportunity to discuss how computation and application is only a 
            small part of mathematics. The questions <q>What do I know?</q> and
            <q>What can I use?</q> and <q>What can I try?</q> should be encouraged 
            as students work. Our toolbox currently contains the three principles on
            area, our knowledge of arithmetic and area, and the definitions in this 
            section. We will continue to build our toolbox as the course progresses. 
        </p>

            Students have very little experience using an index or glossary. They may 
            benefit from having the index of this textbook pointed out to them. Should they 
            be unsure of terminology or notation later in the course, they should be able 
            to locate this infomation quickly via the index.

        <title>Notes for <xref ref="sec-intro-share"/></title>
        <p>
            This section is new, but I have experimented with some tasks to develop 
            early mathematical writing skills. I have asked students to write a short paper in which 
            they give me instructions on how to perform a (nonmathematical) task. I've also  
            done an inclass "jigsaw group activity" in which groups of students are given 
            different pattern block designs and have to write instructions on how to recreate 
            the design. They then are paired with someone from a different group and attempt 
            to recreate the design from the instructions. Pictures are not allowed in the instructions,
            but we later discuss how pictures and precise vocabulary would have been helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section is designed to introduce students to the importance of understanding, 
            explaining, and communicating mathematics as a way of continuing the subject.
            I normally assign two explanatory papers in the next chapter. In them, I do 
            not force a formal proof-writing style, but I do 
            encourage students to develop their ability to write clearly, to include and 
            discuss diagrams, to use variables instead of specific measurements, 
            to refer previously established principles and facts, and to
            use implications appropriately. The letter from Sid to Aunt Josephine serves as 
            a sample for students as they write later letters of explanation. Of course, 
            students may choose to write to a client or use a different form of communication.

        <title>Notes for <xref ref="sec-intro-struggle"/></title>
        <p>
            The activity in this section starts easy, but becomes more challenging.
            Students typically find squares and triangles that have at least one vertical 
            or horizontal side, but may need encouragement to <sq>look at the problem 
            differently.</sq> In fact, it might be worth noting how triangles with a base of 1 and 
            a height of 2 can look so different.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vertices of the polygons must be at the geoboard pegs even though you can 
            have rubberbands crossing elsewhere. Eventually, some students will start creating triangles with no vertical or 
            horizontal sides. Encourage them to come up with their own strategies to compute 
            the areas. Answer questions with questions. What are they thinking? What have 
            they tried? My students have expanded my knowledge of what is possible here. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some semesters, students with a more extensive mathematical background will use 
            more complicated procedures like the Pythagorean Theorem and Heron's formula. If 
            the rest of their group is able to participate in the discussion I let them continue. 
            On the other hand, very little mathematics is needed to use the negative space; that
            is, finding the area of an inner square by subtracting outer triangles from a rectangle.
            The student who makes this observation often has a confidence boost from sharing this 
            in a post-activity discussion. If it does not appear that anyone in the class is 
            headed in this direction, I have posted a picture of one group's triangle and then 
            drawn the box around it watching students' expressions for a possible "aha." 
            Another time, I started the subsequent class by displaying the following picture and asking
            students to write what they notice and wonder.

                four. A triangle formed by connecting the vertices (0,2), (3,4), and (4,0).

        <p>
            To my surprise, several students noticed incorrectly that the triangle was 
            isosceles. This led to a worthwhile investigation into how they might convince 
            me that it was isosceles and helping them see why visual claims did not hold.
