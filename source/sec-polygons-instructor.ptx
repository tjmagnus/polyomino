            Although students may know the area formulas for a parallelogram and a 
            triangle, they don't necessarily know how they are related and why height 
            is such an important parameter. Students are less likely to know the area 
            of a trapezoid, which is fine since it is rarely used, but this activity 
            enables them to reconstruct the formula. The emphasis in this section is 
            on creativity, justification, and communication, not computation.  
            this can be an opportunity to demonstrate how the use of labels makes it 
            easier to communicate clearly. I typically assign the trapezoid area "letter"
            as one of the two major explanatory papers in the course. The most common 
            dissection created by students involves cutting the trapezoid into a 
            rectangle and two triangles. Unfortunately, this dissection is the hardest 
            one to work with algebraically as it requires breaking the longer 
            base into three parts and introducing two extra variables. After they have 
            completed the inclass activity, I show them the following picture of some possible dissections 
            that previous students have used.

            Students should have access to a protractor. Not all students will know how to 
            use one correctly. If the protractor has a hole to align with the vertex, that 
            will be useful in measuring spherical angles in section 
            <xref ref="sec-polygons-parallel"/>

        <p>
            This is a new section and has not been tested in a class. I'm still trying 
            to strike a balance between introducing students to the strange and exciting 
            world of non-Euclidean geometry without overwhelming them with mathematical 
            rigor. I have used some of the activities in worksheet form, but the reading sections 
            are new and may change. I encourage you to try the spherical triangle activity 
            in advance to decide whether physical spheres will work for your class and 
            how to measure angles. Alternatively, you might 
            consider using the geogebra app <url href="www.geogebra.org/m/j4yqa9jd"/>, 
            authored by Heather Pierce, to have students
            draw lines and triangles on a virtual sphere. 
            <!--Consider adding resources on spherical and hyperbolic geometry 
                for teachers who want more.-->
        </p>
        <p>
            I am considering adding an exploration of hyperbolic triangles in the exercise 
            section or as an optional subsection.

        <title>Notes for <xref ref="sec-polygons-regular"/></title> 
      <p>
        Explorations into regular and semiregular tilings will encourage students  
        to discover the total angle measure of a convex <m>n-</m>gon, to develop 
        a formula for the vertex angle of a regular <m>n-</m>gon, and to observe how  
        alternating patterns can continue around even-sided polygons but not odd ones.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For in-class exploration, you may opt to have pattern blocks or stencils 
        available to assemble and trace, but most sets of pattern blocks do not include 
        regular pentagons, regular heptagons, regular octagons, etc. The online application 
         <url href="mathigon.org/polypad#geometry"> Polypad by Mathigon
        </url>, provides regular polygons for <m>n=3</m> through <m>n=8</m> and 
        regular <m>n</m>-gons can be created using the "regular" tile and dragging the 
        dot. Some interactives and images will be included in the exploration activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The end of this section, from <xref first="subsec-semireg-rules" 
        last="subsec-polygons-regular-summary"/>,
        can be omitted depending on the level of reasoning and rigor you 
        wish to develop and the interests of your students. 
        There will be an optional section in <xref ref="ch-polyhedra"/> 
        on semiregular polyhedra that applies what is developed here. 
        In that section, students can also learn and explore the 
        possibilities without delving into the governing rules. Even if you choose to 
        skip this section, you might want to have worked through the following 
        activities or read about the topic to prepare yourself to lead a discussion. I have
        also used the following explorations as a way to engage fast groups in class 
        discovery while other groups  are catching up.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section also offers the opportunity for further explorations into 
        dual tilings, tilings with nonregular polygons, creating art from regular 
        tilings, and asymmetric tilings. A few of these are suggested in the list of  
        projects at the end of this section. My students have enjoyed hearing about 
        Marjorie Rice, a housewife, mother, and amateur mathematician who famously 
        discovered new pentagonal tiles. As you look at other resources, note that the 
        terms <q>tiling</q> and <q>tessellation</q> are used interchangeably.
      </p>
    <p>
        The web application <url href="https://mathigon.org/polypad#polygons">Polypad
        by Mathigon</url> provides regular <m>n</m>-gons for <m>3\leq n\leq 8</m>. 
        These are the top six shapes in the Polygons and Shapes menu. Simply 
        drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area. Rotate using the black dot 
        and move by clicking on the interior. For <m>n</m>-gons with <m>n>8</m>, use  
        the hexagon labeled "regular" in the bottom rom of shapes. After you have moved this  
        figure into the whiteboard, use the dotted vertex to increase the number of sides.
        You can then use the duplicated sheet icon on the flip/cut/... menu to make copies 
        of your <m>n</m>-gon.

        <title>Notes for <xref ref="sec-polygons-length"/></title>
        <p>
            To be added. I assign an explanatory letter on the Pythagorean theorem.
            I need to go back and fix some of the puzzles. Because three of the 
            blue copies of triangles are duplicates of the first, they do not 
            expand if you change the shape of <m>\Delta ABC</m>, but the first  
            triangle does. Until this is fixed, encourage students not to touch 
            <m>\Delta ABC</m>. They can use the reset icon or Ctrl-Z to go back if a 
            student does 
            this. They can also refresh the webpage and it will go back to the 
            original. It should stay on the same page.
