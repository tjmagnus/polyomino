  <title>Building a Course Toolbox</title>
<p>
  Throughout our learning, and in fact throughout our lives, we add knowledge to our toolkit
  that we can later reference as needed. The tools in our toolkit can then be used to solve problems, 
  to further build our understanding of related concepts, and to support the validity of an argument.
  Most likely, you are already familiar with some of these tools from previous coursework. 
  You know how to perform 
  computations, have used geometric formulas, and can recognize many shapes. 
</p>
<p> 
  Although you already know some of the facts and formulas, we 
  will develop a toolbox from the ground up in this course, starting with basic principles and assumptions 
  that are intuitively obvious. With geometric formulas and theorems, we will want to explore 
  why these are true before adding them to our toolbox. When we need to assume a statement without 
  proving it, we will acknowledge the assumption and identify it as a principle rather than a 
  theorem. Theorems will be justified logically from the principles and previously proved theorems. 
  Definitions are developed to give us helpful terminology and state the characteristics needed to 
  identify the object. We typically do not include every property of an object in the definition; 
  some properties can be proved from the initial definition. For example, we define a rectangle  
  to be a quadraliteral with four right angles. The property that opposite sides of a rectangle  
  are congruent is not included in the definition, because it can be proved from the definition.
</p>
<p>
  Depending on the level of a geometry textbook and the author's goals, you will see some differences 
  between the statements of geometric definitions and principles (also called axioms). For this reason, a 
  proof you find elsewhere may not be sufficient here due to its reliance on different assumptions.
  Students are encouraged to use the resources in this text for their work. In addition, you should be  
  mindful of the order in which theorems are introduced as you cannot use a theorem that comes later  
  in the textbook as an argument in a proof. On the other hand, this textbook is not as rigorous as 
  some geometry textbooks. In order to maintain the exploratory and intuitive nature of this book, the 
  author will include some principles here that might appear as proved theorems in other texts. 
  At times, proofs may be included as exercises leaving the choice of rigor up to the course instructor. 
</p>
<!--Insert Circular Reasoning example as an exercise?-->
<p> 
  Currently our course toolbox only 
  contains the definition of <xref ref="def-area">area</xref> and two principles, 
  <xref ref="principle-arearect"/> and <xref ref="principle-areasums"/> from 
  <xref ref="sec-intro-explore"/>. In other words, we can think about the area of a region as 
  the number of <m>1\times1</m> blocks that fills the interior, we can use the area formula 
  for a rectangle, and we know that
  the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. 
  Hopefully, you will agree that length should also be additive; namely,
  that if we extend a segment of length <m>n</m> by a segment of length 
  <m>m</m>, the resulting segment has length <m>n+m</m>. We restate this 
  below:

</aside>
<principle xml:id="principle-addlengths">
  <title>Additivity of Length</title>
<statement>
  <p>
    Suppose that <m>C</m> is a point on the interior of line segment 
    <m>\overline{AB}</m>, then the length of <m>\overline{AB}</m> equals
    the sum of the lengths of <m>\overline{AC}</m> and <m>\overline{CB}</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
</principle>
<p>
  Since we are most interested in discovering facts and formulas that will hold 
  for a whole class of geometric shapes, we will often use variables to represent 
  numerical quantities such as length, area, and angle measure. We include in 
  our toolbox the <xref ref="field-properties">algebraic rules and procedures 
  in</xref> that allow us to perform 
  calculations, simplify expressions, and solve equations. There is a 
  <xref ref="algebra-principles">section</xref> in this book's 
  appendix (back matter) on algebra for your review and reference. 
</p>

<p>
  Eventually we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean theorem, 
  area formulas for other shapes, and other geometrical theorems and formulas, but the
  reasons behind these will be explored in future sections and based on definitions and the initial 
  principles. 
</p>
<p> 
  As we encounter and state new definitions, these too 
  will be added to our tool box. As you work through the next exploration, you will 
  encounter terms like trapezoid and isosceles. Definitions for these and other terms are 
  provided at the end of this section in case you would like to refresh your memory. You can 
  also use the index or textbook's search tool to find definitions.

<title>Explorations with Tangrams</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this exploration, use the tools currently in our toolbox as you answer the questions. 
    You may find yourself wanting to use the Pythagorean theorem 
    and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions 
    without these formulas. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean theorem, there is  
    probably an easier method!
  </p>
  <p>
    A set of tangrams consists of the following seven pieces, two large triangles, one medium 
    triangle, a parallelogram, a square, and two small triangles. 
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="Tangrampieces">
    <caption>The Seven Tangrams</caption>
    <image source="tangram_pieces">
      <description>
        Seven tangram shapes. The triangles are all isosceles right triangles and the parallelogram 
        is equilateral. The small triangles can be arranged to fill either the square, 
        the parallelogram, or the medium triangle. The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same 
        as the base of the large triangle. 
      </description>

    To complete this exploration, you will need to move the seven Tangram pieces 
    around. If you do not have a set of Tangrams, you may print and cut out the 
    shapes shown above. A tangram interactive is also availabe on Polypad by Mathigon

  <p>
    In this exercise, we have practiced using our initial principles and 
    identified some tools, namely the Pythagorean Theorem and the area formula 
    for a triangle, that will be developed later. We also noted that there are 
    multiple ways to solve a problem. Solutions do not need to use formulas and 
    should evolve from what we know and what we have in our toolbox. Still, we  
    want to grow our toolbox to increase our ability to solve problems and justify 
    claims.

    Perhaps you moved figures around and lined up sides to determine whether the lengths  
    were the same. <!--definition and principle of congruence-->

    <title>Defining Polygons</title>
<p>
  In the first part of this course, we will work 
  primarily with polygons. What is a polygon? Giving a clear, clean definition of the word
  "polygon" is difficult so we will describe it verbally and give several examples. If you search for 
  the definition in books or on the web, you will find different attempts to give a clear definition.
  We will describe a <term>polygon</term> <idx><h>polygon</h></idx> as being a closed plane figure 
  formed by a sequence of straight sides.  
  Thus, a polygon is a shape that lies in the plane or on a flat surface. By closed, we mean 
  that a polygon will have a well-defined interior; the polygon forms a solid boundary between this 
  interior and the rest of the plane.

      <title>Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles</title>
      <p>
        Some textbooks will restrict the term isosceles triangle to a triangle with exactly two  
        congruent sides while others allow two or all three of the sides to be congruent. 
        This latter definition is used when one is  
        one wants to argue that properties of isosceles triangles extend to equilateral triangles.

        Should you become a teacher, it is wise to be mindful of how your textbook uses these terms. In the early 
        sections of this text, we will distinguish between isosceles and equilateral triangles  
        when you are asked to sketch and identify examples. When we explore properties of triangles, 
        you may use the fact that properties of an isosceles triangle will also hold for equilateral  
        triangles.

        In case you are curious, <sq>equilateral</sq> comes from Latin and French words meaning equal 
        sides.

          A <term>kite</term> is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent

                  An isosceles triangle made up of a large isosceles 
                  triangle that fills the left half. The right half consists of
