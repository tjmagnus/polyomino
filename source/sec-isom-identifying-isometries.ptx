  <title>Identifying Isometries</title>

    <title>What do we know? What do we wonder?</title>
    <!--<introduction>-->
        <p>
                As we continue to build on our knowledge of isometries, 
                it is wise to summarize what we know so far. 
                We know that a transformation of a plane is a mapping or function 
                that sends each point <m>P</m> on the
                plane to a unique point <m>P'</m> called its image under the 
                transformation. Some transformations are 
                <term>collineations</term>, meaning that if a set of 
                points all lie on the same line, then their images will also lie on 
                a single line. 
                We have observed that some collineations preserve shape and angle 
                measure and that some collineations 
                that preserve angle measure will also preserve distance. 
                The transformations that preserve all of these, 
                collinearity, angle measure, and distance, are called <term>isometries</term>.

    <title>Isometry Between Congruent Figures</title>
    <p>
        We are familiar with three types of isometries: reflections, 
        translations, and rotations. Yet many questions remain: 
        Are there other types of isometries? 
        Are there transformations that are not isometries? We have seen that 
        the image of a polygon under an isometry is congruent to the original 
        polygon. But what about the converse? If two figures are congruent, 
        is there always an isometry mapping one to the other? If so, how do we 
        determine what type of isometry it is? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Although we have not proved this fact, it is true that if we have two congruent figures,
        there will be an isometry that maps one onto the other. 
        Our goal in this section and next will be to identify the type of isometry 
        that takes one figure onto a congruent copy. Is it a reflection, a translation, 
        a rotation, or something else? Then having determined the type can we specify 
        the exact action that performs the movement. A good place to start is to 
        identify whether the isometry maintains orientation.

                action of an isometry as moving <m>\Delta ABC</m> so that it aligns 
                perfectly with its image <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m>. Which isometries--reflections,

                where the orientation is the same. How do you know whether a translation 
                takes <m>\Delta ABC</m> to <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m>? How do you know whether

        Another way to distinguish between isometries is to note which points,
        if any, are unmoved by the isometry. Such a point is called a <term>fixed 
        point</term> of the isometry. Fixed points may occur when the transformation 
        is not an isometry as well, so we will state the definition more generally.

          Like the function <m>f(x)=x</m> you may have encountered in another
          course, there is a transformation of the plane that maps every point to 
          itself. We call this transformation, the <term>identity transformation</term>.
          Under the action of the identity transformation, every point is a fixed point.
          Clearly, the identity function also preserves distance, angle measure, and 
          orientation since it leaves everything unchanged.

      <title>Defining Objects of Isometries</title>
        <p>
          Once we determine whether the isometry mapping one 
          figure onto a congruent image is a reflection, translation,
          or rotation, we need to specify which reflection, which 
          translation, or which rotation it is. We do this by identifying 
          the defining object(s) of the isometry. With a reflection, for example,
          we specify which line we are reflecting across. This line is unique;
          no other line will give the same reflection. 
          <xref ref="table-def-obj-1"/> lists the defining 
          objects for the three isometries we have studied.

            <introduction>
              <p>
                In <xref ref="explor-isom-RAT-translation"/>, you were given a 
                translation vector <m>\overrightarrow{FG}</m> which indicated the direction and 
                distance that each point should be moved, specifically three units
                right and one unit down. In the activity <m>E</m> had the coordinates  
                <m>(2,4)</m> and <m>F</m> had the coordinates <m>(5,3)</m>. 
                The difference of the <m>x</m>-values, <m>5-2=3</m>, gives the 
                number of units moved right, and the difference of the <m>y</m>-values 
                <m>3-4=-1</m> tells us how far to move up. Since this latter difference 
                is negative, we move down instead of up. Note that we could have chosen 
                a different vector to represent <q>three units right and one unit down.</q>
