        My hope is to continue improving the book, releasing a new edition each spring 
        in time for fall adoptions.  These new editions will incorporate additions and 
        corrections suggested by instructors and students who use the text the previous 
        semesters.
        Thus I encourage you to send along any corrections, suggestions, and comments 
        as you have them.

    <title>How to use this book</title>
    <p permid="Gcy">
      The author is writing this textbook during a 2023-2024 sabbatical. Updates and 
      additions will be deployed every week or two to 
      <url href=" https://tjmagnus.github.io/polyomino/"/>. Suggestions on how to improve
      this textbook are appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Instructor's Version is available to faculty upon request. Email the author at 
      <url href="tmagnus@rivier.edu">tmagnus@rivier.edu</url> with your name, contact information, 
      and the link to a webpage verifying your role as instructor.

      <title>Exploration activities</title>
      <p permid="QBD">
        Explorations are an essential part of this course. Students, often in groups, make  
        sense of the mathematics and take ownership of the content by discovering relationships 
        through hands-on activities. I am happy to share the classroom worksheets  
        on which this course is based. In fact, I plan to continue to use handouts for 
        most of the inclass explorations even after this textbook is complete. I plan  
        to add many of these to an instructor-accessible  
        website. Instructors wanting to use these sooner should email me!

      <title>Interactive Online Version</title>
      <p permid="pen">
        For those of you reading this in a PDF or in print, I encourage you to also check out 
        the interactive online version, which makes navigating the book a little easier.  
        Additionally, many of the activities are implemented as GeoGebra or Polypad applets, 
        which allow you to work interactively inside the textbook. Some exercises can be checked 
        inside the online textbook and hyperlinks to definitions and other items are included. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope is to add other features, like how-to-use-the-software videos, in the future.
        You can view the interactive version for free at 
        <url href=" https://tjmagnus.github.io/polyomino/"/><!--or by scanning the 
          QR code below with your smart phone-->.
