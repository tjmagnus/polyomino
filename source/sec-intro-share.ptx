    <title>Identifying a Pattern</title>

      We begin this section by creating a pattern and using it to develop a 
      conjecture.

          The expression <m>1+3+5+\cdots + 11</m> is another way of writing 
          <m>1+3+5+7+9+11</m>. We write enough addends to establish a pattern  
          and then the <m>\cdots </m> tells the reader that the pattern continues.
          The <m>+11</m> at the end indicates that the sum will end when the pattern

    <title>Conjectures and Explanations in Mathematics</title>
    <p>
      Have you ever wondered how mathematics came into existence? A simple answer is 
      that people explored mathematical objects, like numbers or shapes, and noticed 
      patterns and consistencies. They then sought to convince themselves and others that 
      these patterns were not just coincidences but universal properties of the 
      numberic or geometric structure. For example, they observed and then proved that 
      whenever a triangle had two sides of equal length the angles opposite those sides 
      would be congruent.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we convince others? In mathematics, we start with basic assumptions like 
      the principles and definitions in this text  
      and then use logic to demonstrate that our conjecture must follow. We also accept 
      the algebraic properties of the 
      real number system along with properties of equality and inequality, allowing us  
      to simplify algebraic expressions and solve linear equalities and inequalities  
      using techniques learned in previous courses. 
      Once we prove a claim, it is no longer a conjecture and is now considered to be a theorem. We can then add the theorem to 
      our toolbox and use it to demonstrate new claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this textbook is written for students majoring in fields other than mathematics, we will not 
      spend time developing proof-writing techniques. Even so, everyone can benefit from learning to 
      write clear and thorough explanations and demonstrations. Future teachers should develop the 
      ability to explain mathematics carefully and accurately, using words, pictures, and multiple approaches 
      that their students can understand. For a future lawyer or business professional, the practice of writing 
      explanatory papers in mathematics will enhance their ability to 
      present and support arguments for their cases and proposals. As you write explanations, choose an 
      audience that makes sense for you--a student, a friend, a colleague, a jury
      --and use language appropriate for that audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we write mathematical explanations and establish new truths? 
      We usually let our readers know  
      what we claim and plan to prove. In geometry, we often accompany our explanations with a sketch on which 
      we have labeled with the names of points and/or variables for lengths so that our reader can follow our 
      argument visually. We do not assign numerical values to lengths as we do not want to limit our claim to 
      one example. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sum-odds"/>, we discovered a formula for the sum 
      of the first <m>n</m> odd numbers. It appears to equal <m>n^2</m>, but why? 
      Simply observing the pattern via a few examples, does not convince us that 
      this will also be the case for <m>n=1000</m>. Something strange might happen 
      between 5 and 1000. Instead, consider the following <q>proof by pictures</q>:

    <title>A Sample Explanatory Letter</title>
    <p>
      The following letter demonstrates how we might write a thorough, yet informal, 
      explanatory letter. Note the use of variables for a general argument and labeled 
      sketches to help the reader follow our argument.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Dear Aunt Josephine,
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been thinking about you a lot lately and how much I appreciated 
        your help when I was learning algebra. You may remember how much I struggled 
        with understanding why <m>(x+1)^2</m> equals <m>x^2+2x+1</m> instead of 
        <m>x^2+1</m> in that course. In my current geometry course, I learned a 
        geometric argument for that equation that makes more sense to me and I thought 
        you might like it too.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the picture below, you can see a square with side <m>n+1</m> 
          broken up into four rectangles. (Here, I am using <m>n</m> in place of <m>x</m>.)
          The area of this square is <m>(n+1)^2</m> of course. Notice that <m>n^2+1</m>
          is the sum of the areas of the <m>n\times n</m> square (top left) and 
          the small <m>1\times 1</m> square (lower right). These do not fill the 
          entire square so <m>(n+1)^2</m> must be greater than <m>n^2+1</m>. The two missing pieces are 
          rectangles with area <m>n\times 1=n</m>. Adding all four pieces, we see  
          <m>(n+1)^2=n^2+2n+1</m>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
          <p>
        Now that I have seen this geometrically I remember the formula much better!
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you and Uncle Tom are doing well. I look forward to visiting you 
        soon.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Notice how the author Sid introduces the reader to what will be demonstrated, 
      uses a picture to help the reader visualize the explanation, and then explains  
      in words how the picture justifies the argument. In this example, Sid 
      has to deal with the fact that we typically use the variable <m>x</m> in algebra 
      to represent any real number but the variable <m>n</m>, representing whole numbers  
      appeared in the sketch. Aunt Josephine is alerted to the fact that <m>n</m>  
      would be used in place of <m>x</m> and Sid consistently uses <m>n</m> in 
      the logical argument. The author could have drawn a new sketch and relabeled it 
      with <m>x</m> in place of <m>n</m>, but chose not to do so. Since the author is  
      using the sketch from the activity, a citation reference should be included. In fact, 
      if a tool like Polypad or GeoGebra is used to create a sketch, the technology 
      should be credited. Also, note how Aunt Josephine did not have to see the questions 
      in the activity to understand Sid's explanation.
