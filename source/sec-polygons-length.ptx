    <title>Exploring Length and the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Dating from before 500 B.C., the Pythagorean Theorem allows us to 
        compute lengths associated with right triangles.  
        Upon completing this section, you should be able to explain to 
        others how the Pythagorean Theorem follows from our basic principles.
        First, we introduce some terminology and refresh our memory on how to 
        apply the theorem.

        As noted in

        is a triangle with one right angle. The longest side, called the 
        <term>hypotenuse</term>, of a right triangle
        is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides of the right 
        triangle are called the <term>legs</term>.

  <title>The Pythagorean Theorem</title>

    The Pythagorean Theorem states that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths of
    the sides of a right triangle and <m>c</m> is the length of the hypotenuse,
    then <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>.

  <title>Proving the Pythagorean Theorem with Picture Puzzles</title>
  <p>
    The Pythagorean Theorem is very useful, but it is also somewhat mysterious.
    Why does the formula work for all right triangles? Surprisingly, there are 
    more than 350 recognized proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. We will look at 
    just a few. In the following exploration,
    you will rearrange polygons built from a right triangle,
    and use the rearrangements to explain why 
    <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m> in each case. You are encouraged to try all the proofs in 
    this section and to choose one to learn well enough to convince others.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      The book, <em>The Pythagorean Proposition</em>, by Elisha S. Loomis, (NCTM:1968) 
      contains 367 proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. 
      <!--also he published a nonproof in 1901.-->

              Right triangle ABC with right angle at C. Point D is placed on ray

              line DE is perpendicular to AD and segment DE is the same length as AC. Points E and B

  <title>Reflecting on the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
  <p>
    Most people can state the Pythagorean Theorem and use it to find missing lengths in a right triangle,
    but in this section you have learned why the theorem holds for all right triangles. We have practiced 
    using variables in our arguments so that our explanation is not just shown for a right triangle with 
    lengths 3, 4, and 5 (or 5, 12, and 13), but for all right triangles. Even so, the fact that we used  
    puzzle pieces enables us to share this knowledge with anyone who has at least a fourth grade knowledge  
    of geometry, area, and square numbers. A few of our proofs did not require the algebraic representation 
    and symbolic manipulation learned in middle or high school.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, we need to be careful that we do not try to apply this theorem to non-right 
    triangles. It is possible to create a triangle whose side lengths are 3, 5, and 6, but this triangle will  
    not have a right angle. In fact, the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem states that if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
    and <m>c</m> are sides of a triangle with <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>, then the triangle will have a right angle 
    opposite the side with length <m>c</m>. <!--We will not prove this converse OR DO I PUT IT AS AN EXERCISE. -->
