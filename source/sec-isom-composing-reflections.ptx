  <title>Compositions of Reflections</title>
<subsection>
    <title>Compositions</title>
    <p>
      Each of the transformations we have studied so far, reflections, translations, and rotations, 
      performs an action on the points of the plane. In fact, a transformation is a <term>function</term>
      where the inputs and outputs are geometric objects instead of numbers. In algebra, you learned 
      about the <q>add three</q> function, written <m>f(x)=x+3</m>, and the <q>multiply by four
      </q> function, <m>g(x)=4x</m>. You also learned that you could perform two functions in succession.
      For example, you could perform the <q>add three</q> function on the number <m>1</m> and then 
      perform the <q>multiply by 4</q> function on the result. 
      <me>
        1 \overset{x+3}{\rightarrow} 4  \overset{4x}{\rightarrow} 16
      </me>
      In function notation, we may write  <m>g(f(1))=g(1+3)=g(4)=4(4)=16</m> where we perform 
      the inner function first. We may also perform these operations on a generic value <m>x</m>:
      <me>g(f(x))=g(x+3)=4(x+3)=4x+12.</me> We note the importance of order. If we multiply by 4
      first and add 3 second, we get a different result:
      <me>f(g(x))=f(4x)=(4x)+3=4x+3.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We now explore what happens when we compose geometric transformations. We could compose any 
      two transformations, but we will first focus on reflections. What happens when we perform 
      two or more reflections in succession? Do we get another reflection? Does it matter whether 
      the lines are parallel? Does the order in which we perform the reflections matter?

      <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>composition</term> of two transformations is a sequence of two transformations, 
        <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, performed 
        in succession. To find the image of a point <m>P</m> under the composition, <m>s</m> 
        followed by <m>t</m>, written <m>t(s(P))</m>, one first finds the image <m>P'</m>
        of <m>P</m> under the action of <m>s</m> and then finds the image <m>P''</m> of  
        <m>P'</m> under <m>t</m>.
        <me>
          P \overset{s}\rightarrow s(P)=P' \overset{t}\rightarrow t(P')=P''.
        </me>
        Note that in the composition <m>P \rightarrow s(t(P))</m>, we perform the inside function 
        <m>t</m> before the outer function <m>s</m>.
      </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        We can also use the notation <m>t\circ s</m> to represent the composition of <m>t</m> 
        composed with <m>s</m>. It's action on point <m>P</m> is written <m>t(s(P))</m>.

          First we explore what happens when you reflect an object first across line <m>g</m>

            For the remainder of this activity, we will only be interested in the 
            original pentomino <m>ABCDEF</m> and the final image <m>A''B''C''D''E''F''</m>.
            You may hide  
            the intermediate objects so that it is easier to focus on <m>ABCDEF</m>
            and <m>A''B''C''D''E''F''</m> by right-clicking on each object and then 
            unchecking <sq>show object</sq>. Another option found by right-clicking is  
            to change the color of the object.
            Do not delete any intermediate construction as it will cause later 
            constructions to also be deleted. If you delete accidentally, use the 
            undo arrow on the right end of the toolbar to recover your work.

            Each type of isometry has a special object or two that helps to determine it precisely.  
            As shown in <xref ref="table-def-obj-2"/>, a reflection has a reflecting line, a 
            translation has a vector, and a rotation has a center 
            and angle.  Identify and draw in the specific line, vector, or center and angle for this 
            transformation.  How does this object relate to the parallel reflecting lines <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>?  
            Verify your answer using the transformation tools in geogebra.

        <title>Reflecting across three intersecting lines</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Finally, we reflect the triangle across three lines, at least some 
            of which intersect.  Use the <sq>Reflect about Line</sq> tool to reflect 
            <m>\Delta ABC</m> across <m>d</m>, then reflect its image <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m> 
            across line <m>e</m>, and finally reflect <m>\Delta A''B''C''</m> across 
            <m>f</m>. After creating <m>\Delta A'''B'''C'''</m>, you should hide the two 
            intermediate triangles <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m> and <m>\Delta A''B''C''</m>
            and their vertices.

      <title>The Four Isometries</title>
    <p> 
        In this chapter, we've explored the behavior of a particular type of transformation,
        called an <term>isometry</term>. This term comes from the Greek words <q>iso-</q> meaning 
        <q>equality</q> and <q>metria</q> meaning <q>measure</q>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-isometry">
      <idx><h>isometry</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>isometry</term> is a function taking points on the plane to points on 
          the plane which sends collinear points to collinear points and 
          preserves the distance between points. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>   
    <p>
      There are four types of isometries.  Through our explorations, we have seen that the 
      orientation of a figure is reversed each time it is reflected. Thus,
      orientation is changed under an odd number of reflections and maintained 
      (flipped back) under an even number of reflections. Hence, the 
      composition of two reflections in succession will be  
      either a translation (when the reflecting lines are parallel) or a 
      rotation (when the reflecting lines intersect). When we reflect 
      across three lines, not all of which are parallel, we get an isometry 
      which reverses the orientation of figures but is not a reflection.  
      Instead we obtain what is known as a glide reflection. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        A <term>glide reflection</term> is defined as a composition of a reflection across 
        a line and a translation along a vector parallel to (or on) the 
        reflecting line. In <xref ref="illustrated-glref"/>, note how the pentomino is first 
        reflected across the line and then translated along vector 
        <m>\overrightarrow{GH}</m>.  Any of the parallel vectors, like 
        <m>\overrightarrow{A'A''}</m> or <m>\overrightarrow{CC''}</m>, 
        could be used as the translation vector, but the reflecting line here 
        is <m>\overleftrightarrow{GH}</m>, not <m>\overleftrightarrow{CC''}</m>.
