      <title>Growing through Persistance</title>
 
      <p>
        Have you ever watched a baby learn a new skill, like walking, crawling, or even 
        rolling over? The child does not master the skill on the first try, but they are 
        determined. They fall down, perhaps bump their head, but they keep trying. They readjust what they are doing, 
        figure out how to create momentum and balance, and finally succeed. Even then they 
        may stumble, but they persist. In the process, they grow stronger and can apply these  
        skills to later learning, like running, climbing the cabinets, and reaching the cookie jar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout our lives, we grow by challenging ourselves to move beyond our comfort zone. 
        We learn to read and write, play games and sports, cook, make music, or create art. 
        Our brains are muscles that develop as we attempt new challenges. The 
        nature of mathematics involves struggling with a problem, trying different 
        strategies, taking breaks but persisting, and learning from failed attempts. In the explorations 
        of this section, 
        you may find that some of the problems are easy, but others require looking at 
        the problem in new ways and trying different strategies. Accept the challenge, 
        try out different ideas, and don't worry about making mistakes. Allow these attempts to 
        enable growth and eventual success.

      <title>Triangles on a Geoboard</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          You may use tools that you remember from previous courses, such as 
          the area formula for a triangle and the Pythagorean Theorem, as you 
          complete this activity. We will explore why these formulas hold in 
          <xref ref="ch-polygons"/>.

            In this exploration, we will work with a geoboard that has four rows 
            and four columns of pins such as the one pictured below.

                Measuring along any row, we will assume that the horizontal 
                distance between neighboring dots on a geoboard is one unit. 
                What is the distance across the top of the geoboard from the leftmost 
                pin to the rightmost pin?

                Similarly, the vertical distance between neighboring pins in any 
                column will be one unit. Determine the area of the square whose vertices 
                are the four outermost pins on this geoboard.

      <title>Confronting the Challenge</title>
      <p>
        To give you the experience of confronting the challenge and the exhilaration 
        of conquering it, the answer to the last task in this exploration will not 
        be provided here. Searching for solutions or examples will not help you grow mathematically. 
        Instead, consider other ways in which you might attack the problem. Dare to 
        try something new!
      </p>
      <p>
        The above exploration starts off relatively easy. 
        Once you understood 
        how to create and measure shapes on the geoboard, you probably found  
        triangles with areas of <m>\frac{1}{2}, 1, 
        \frac{3}{2}, 2, 3</m>, and <m>\frac{9}{2}</m>. In fact, you might have found  
        multiple triangles with these areas. Yet the remaining areas may
        seem impossible. If you are still in this situation, think about why these  
        same six areas keep occurring. What do these triangles have in common?  
        What other types of triangles exist on the GeoBoard?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you find these new triangles, another question emerges: How does one 
        compute the area of these triangles?
        To use the area formula, <m>A=\frac{1}{2}bh</m>, one usually uses the 
        values of <m>b</m> and <m>h</m>. How does one find <m>b</m> and <m>h</m> with 
        certainty? Or is it necessary to find the base and height of the triangle? 
        Might there be other ways of finding the area in the current setting?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many lessons to be learned here that go beyond measuring area. 
        Mathematics is not about doing fast calculations with provided formulas or 
        following steps. Instead, it requires persistence, creative thinking, and 
        exploring multiple strategies. Sometimes it is helpful to walk away from a problem for a 
        little while and to return to it with a different perspective. It helps to 
        share ideas with others even when you do not know where they will lead. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Did you discover a triangle that was not obvious? Did you 
        figure out a way to compute the area of these triangles? Did you 
        help others understand? Be proud of  
        your discoveries and contributions. This is evidence that you, yes you, 
        are a mathematician! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each student brings their own individual strengths to 
        the class. Some are great at remembering and applying formulas while others are 
        great at drawing sketches. Some have a talent for recognizing patterns or building 
        on others' ideas while other students are adept at explaining results and connections. 
        In fact, you may find yourself  
        contributing in different ways on different activities. The important thing 
        is to believe in yourself and be open to trying new things. Unfortunately, 
        most people believe the myth that they can't do math. They spend too much energy
        comparing themselves to others. Math is not about being perfect or fast.
        Instead, mathematics is about exploring, creating, experimenting, conjecturing, applying,
        and justifying.

        If today was not your day to shine, perhaps you were hesitant to consider 
        alternative approaches or to pursue your ideas. This particular topic might 
        not have engaged you in the same way as it did others. Or maybe it was just 
        an off day. There will be more opportunities  
        to overcome challenges throughout this book. As long as you are open to 
        learning and exploring your own ideas, your mathematical ability 
        and confidence will grow. After all, the course has just 
        started, and you are just adapting to this book and its style, your 
        instructor, and your classmates. By the way, your brain may hurt a little as 
        you confront and conquer mathematical challenges. Like every other muscle in 
        your body, a little soreness means that you are growing in strength. Success  
        comes from overcoming the struggle, from remembering and building on your 
        accomplishments and missteps.

      <title>A Geometric Tool and an Algebraic Tool</title>
      <p> 
        As we have noticed in this section, not all segments are horizontal or 
        vertical. To determine the lengths of these slanted segments on a grid, the 
        <xref ref="thm-Pythagorean">Pythagorean Theorem</xref> will be helpful. 
        The Pythagorean Theorem allows us to find the lengths of the sides 
        of right triangles using the fact that <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m> where <m>c</m>
        is the length of the hypotenuse and  <m>a</m>
        and <m>b</m> are the lengths of the legs of the triangle. A more in-depth
        exploration of the Pythagorean 
        Theorem will be pursued in <xref ref="sec-polygons-length"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applying the Pythagorean Theorem requires facility with the algebraic operation
        of squaring and its inverse operation, the square root function. A review of how  
        to work with squares and square roots is provided in 
        <xref ref="subsec-algrev-sqroots" text="global"/> in the Backmatter.

        <p>
          Discuss the emotions that you experienced as you were working on this  
          activity. Did you encounter moments when you felt stuck? How long did 
          that last? What helped you persist through the process? Were you able to 
          get unstuck without being told answers? How did that make you feel? Discussion 
          of other emotional stages of this activity is allowed provided that you 
          focus on the emotions associated with the struggle and challenge of 
          conquering a mathematical task. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If this particular activity did not challenge you as much as an earlier one, then your 
          instructor <em>may</em> give you permission to discuss one of those instead.

        <title>Growing via Challenges</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Reflect on a time when you had to struggle to learn how to do something
            (not necessarily mathematics), but where you eventually succeeded.
            Describe the event, why and how you struggled, 
            what helped you persist, and how you grew. Did you feel differently about 
            this success compared to successfully completing routine tasks? Can this  
            experience help you as you tackle tough questions in this course?
