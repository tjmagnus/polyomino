    <title>Introduction to Geometrical Thinking</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Geometry is all around us; we find it in nature, architecture, art,
        games, and technology. Throughout history, humans have 
        marveled upon geometrical patterns, investigated possibilities, 
        developed geometrical tools, and shared these discoveries with 
        others. Mathematicians use logic to confirm what they observe and to convince other scholars. The theorems and formulas that you 
        have likely encountered in previous classes were developed and refined 
        over the last two millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these formulas and theorems are worth knowing well; for example, 
        basic area and volume formulas, the Pythagorean Theorem, arise 
        frequently in applications and 
        conversations. You can apply geometry to real-world problems, and you 
        will become more literate by demonstrating a strong understanding of 
        geometrical applications. However, 
        memorization and application are not the primary goals of this course. 
        After all, search engines, calculators, and artificial intelligence can 
        recall formulas and perform calculations for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of greater worth, is the ability to see the mathematics around 
        us, to ask questions and seek understanding, to imagine and create, 
        and to share our knowledge with others. In this first chapter and 
        throughout the book, you will be encouraged to practice mathematical 
        habits of mind that will enable you to learn new ideas and delve deeper 
        into familiar topics. At the same time, we will be establishing some
        key geometrical ideas that will be revisited later in the course.
