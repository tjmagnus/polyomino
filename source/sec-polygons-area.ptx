    <title>Why do the area formulas hold?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In these activities we will determine the area formulas for three 
            shapes, a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal 
            will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be  
            able to explain why they follow from the basic principles. In 
            particular, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle,
            <m>A=\ell\times w</m>, as our starting point and derive other 
            area formulas from it.

                    Beginning with the parallelogram pictured below or the one you

                You probably remember the angle formula for a triangle; in fact, you 
                may have used it already in this course! But why is the area

                                to give these lengths new, different labels. If you find that you need to create a lot 
                                of new labels, you might want to use a different construction or deconstruction
                                to reduce the amount of algebra you will need to do later.

                                base, and/or summit. For example, if you split the base into three segments, 
                                labeled <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>, you would write down the relationship

                                created an upside-down triangle, its base may be the summit of the trapezoid, and 
                                so we would use the label <m>b_1</m> (or <m>a</m>) instead of <m>b</m>.

            Thoughts on Area
        </title>
        <p>
            We now have four area formulas in our tool box. One could 
            continue to add more: kites, pentagons, hexagons, etc., but 
            the list would become unwieldly and unhelpful. 
            
            Instead, we will  
            simply break other polygonal shapes into triangles, parallelograms, 
            and other shapes so that we can compute the area of these and add 
            (or subtract) the areas as appropriate. Measuring tools could 
            be used to estimate the dimensions needed to compute the area 
            of physical spaces such as floorspace or a garden.

            we may superimpose the region over a grid of <m>1\times 1</m>-unit squares.

            <title>The Area of a Circle</title>
            <p>
                Although a circle is not a polygon, we include the formula for its area here. In fact, 
                Archimedes (287-212 BC) determined the area of a circle by looking at inscribed and 
                circumscribed polygons. As the number of sides grew, the area of the polygons would 
                approach the area of the circle, with the area of the inscribed polygons giving a lower 
                estimate and the area of the circumscribed polygons giving an overestimate. The number  
                <m>pi</m> was not known at the time, but this method provides a means of calculating 
                <m>pi</m> to any level of precision.

                        The final picture has 16-gons that look almost like the circle itself.
