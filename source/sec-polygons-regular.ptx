      <title>Note to instructors:</title> 
      <p>
        Explorations into regular and semiregular tilings will encourage students  
        to discover the total angle measure of a convex <m>n-</m>gon, to develop 
        a formula for the vertex angle of a regular <m>n-</m>gon, and to observe how  
        alternating patterns can continue around even-sided polygons but not odd ones.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For in-class exploration, you may opt to have pattern blocks or stencils 
        available to assemble and trace, but most sets of pattern blocks do not include 
        regular pentagons, regular heptagons, regular octagons, etc. The online application 
         <url href="mathigon.org/polypad#geometry"> Polypad by Mathigon
        </url>, provides regular polygons for <m>n=3</m> through <m>n=8</m> and 
        regular <m>n</m>-gons can be created using the "regular" tile and dragging the 
        dot. Some interactives and images will be included in the exploration activities.

        The end of this section, from <xref first="subsec-semireg-rules" 
        last="subsec-polygons-regular-summary"/>,
        can be omitted depending on the level of reasoning and rigor you 
        wish to develop and the interests of your students. 
        There will be an optional section in <xref ref="ch-polyhedra"/> 
        on semiregular polyhedra that applies what is developed here. 
        In that section, students can also learn and explore the 
        possibilities without delving into the governing rules. Even if you choose to 
        skip this section, you might want to have worked through the following 
        activities or read about the topic to prepare yourself to lead a discussion. I have
        also used the following explorations as a way to engage fast groups in class 
        discovery while other groups  are catching up.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section also offers the opportunity for further explorations into 
        dual tilings, tilings with nonregular polygons, creating art from regular 
        tilings, and asymmetric tilings. A few of these are suggested in the list of  
        projects at the end of this section. My students have enjoyed hearing about 
        Marjorie Rice, a housewife, mother, and amateur mathematician who famously 
        discovered new pentagonal tiles. As you look at other resources, note that the 
        terms <q>tiling</q> and <q>tessellation</q> are used interchangeably.

        Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this  
        section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings 
        can be used to tile the plane.

    In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominos. 
    In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues  
    infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to 
    build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.

        This activity may be completed using physical tiles or 
        in an app. Be sure to save a record of your designs by 
        tracing, photography, or screenshots. Some of the computations  
        will also be used later in this section. You are encourage to 
        keep an accessible record of your work for future reference.

        The web application <url href="https://mathigon.org/polypad#polygons">Polypad
        by Mathigon</url> provides regular <m>n</m>-gons for <m>3\leq n\leq 8</m>. 
        These are the top six shapes in the Polygons and Shapes menu. Simply 
        drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area. Rotate using the black dot 
        and move by clicking on the interior. For <m>n</m>-gons with <m>n>8</m>, use  
        the hexagon labeled "regular" in the bottom rom of shapes. After you have moved this  
        figure into the whiteboard, use the dotted vertex to increase the number of sides.
        You can then use the duplicated sheet icon on the flip/cut/... menu to make copies 
        of your <m>n</m>-gon.

          Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, 
          regular hexagons, and other regular <m>n</m>-gons to determine which can 
          be used to create a regular tiling and which do not. What do you think

          Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure places a role in determining 
          whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. This task will  
          lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We 
          will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other   
          regular n-gons.

  <title>Narrowing Down the Options</title>
    <p>
      When we look at possible vertex arrangements for a semiregular tiling,
      our options are very limited. Not including the regular tiling by squares, 
      you should have found three groups of four regular polygons with an 
      angle sum of 360 degrees. All of these have at least one polygon appearing 
      twice. Why do some of these extend to a semiregular tiling while others do 
      not? Does it matter whether the common polygons are next to each other 
      or separated?    
    </p>
    <p>
      As we attempt to create a 3.3.6.6 pattern, we find that it is impossible to 
      maintain a consistent vertex arrangement. Fairly quickly, we are forced to 
      create a 3.6.3.6 arrangement at some vertices. On the other hand, a 3.3.6.6 
      vertex arrangement can continue indefinitely. Let us explore why this happens.

          Use physical or virtual triangles and hexagons to 
          sketch the vertex arrangement 3.3.6.6 or refer to an earlier  
          sketch if available. <!--Add app?-->
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Choose one of the two triangles at this vertex and attempt 
              to surround it with triangles and/or hexagons while adhering 
              to the 3.3.6.6 arrangement.

          <li>
            <p>
              Note that each triangle in a 3.3.6.6 must share a side with 
              one triangle and one hexagon due to the order of the 3's and 6's.

      tiling of the plane where four polygons meet at a vertex. All three vertex 
      arrangements with five polygons meeting extend to semiregular tilings. 
      To complete this analysis, we consider which three-polygon vertex arrangements  
      extend to a semiregular tiling.
