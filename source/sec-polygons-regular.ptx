  <introduction>

    <p>
        Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this  
        section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings 
        can be used to tile the plane.

  <title>Regular Tilings</title>
  <p>
    In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominoes. 
    In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues  
    infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to 
    build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.

        A <term>tiling</term> is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane 
        (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no 
        gaps and no overlaps. A <term>monohedral tiling</term> is tiling that 
        uses only one shape, 
        a <term>regular tiling</term> is a monohedral tiling using a single 
        regular polygon as its tile. In a regular tiling, each side of a polygon 
        will line up perfectly with a side of an adjacent copy.

        This activity may be completed using physical tiles or 
        in the interactive applet below. Be sure to save a record of your designs by 
        tracing, photography, or screenshots. Some of the computations  
        will also be used later in this section, so you are encourage to 
        keep an accessible record of your work for future reference.

        The web application <url href="https://mathigon.org/polypad#polygons">Polypad
        by Amplify</url> provides regular <m>n</m>-gons for <m>3\leq n\leq 8</m>. 
        These are the top six shapes provided. Simply drag the shape from the 
        left into the whiteboard area and it will make a new copy. Rotate the polygon 
        using the dotted stem and move it by clicking on the interior and 
        dragging. For <m>n</m>-gons with <m>n>8</m>, use  
        the nonagon at the bottom. Pull on the dotted vertex to change the number 
        of sides. With the new <m>n</m>-gon selected, you can now use the 
        duplicated sheet icon on the flip/cut/... menu to make copies 
        of your <m>n</m>-gon. Fullscreen, undo, redo, reset, and extract buttons

          Select a single regular polygon, making copies of it as needed,
          and use it to construct a regular  
          tiling. Construct enough of the tiling to convince others that the

          Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons,

          Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure places a role in determining 
          whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. The steps in 
          this task will lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a 
          regular pentagon. We 
          will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other   
          regular n-gons.

  <title>Narrowing Down the Options</title>
    <p>
      When we look at possible vertex arrangements for a semiregular tiling,
      our options are very limited. Not including the regular tiling by squares, 
      you should have found three groups of four regular polygons with an 
      angle sum of 360 degrees. All of these have at least one polygon appearing 
      twice. Why do some of these extend to a semiregular tiling while others do 
      not? Does it matter whether the common polygons are next to each other 
      or separated?    
    </p>
    <p>
      As we attempt to create a 3.3.6.6 pattern, we find that it is impossible to 
      maintain a consistent vertex arrangement. Fairly quickly, we are forced to 
      create a 3.6.3.6 arrangement at some vertices. On the other hand, a 3.3.6.6 
      vertex arrangement can continue indefinitely. Let us explore why this happens.

          <li>

              one triangle and one hexagon due to the order of the 3's and 6's.

      We conclude that there are only two semiregular tilings and one regular 
      tiling of the plane where four polygons meet at a vertex. All three vertex 
      arrangements with five polygons meeting extend to semiregular tilings. 
      To complete this analysis, we consider which three-polygon vertex arrangements  
      extend to a semiregular tiling.
