      <p>
        In this chapter, we will explore three-dimensional solids. Solids with 
        flat polygonal sides, like cubes and pyramids, are called polyhedra.

                A <term>polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</term> is a 
                three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, a <term>face</term> of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface 
                that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two 
                faces meet are called <term>edges</term>, and the <sq>corners</sq> where  
                edges meet are called the <term>vertices</term> of the polyhedron. The  
                vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of polygonal faces. Unless  
                specified otherwise, we will be measuring the angles formed by a pair of edges  
                which is the same as measuring the angle of a vertex of a polygonal face.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a <sq>side</sq>,
                one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and 
                a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms
                <term>face</term> and <term>edge</term> will make our discussions about polyhedron 
                clearer.

        <answer>
            <p>
                A cube and triangular prism are polyhedra. 
                A cylinder and sphere have curved surfaces.
